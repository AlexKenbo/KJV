On arriving at Jerusalem, Zerubbabel's great work, which he set about immediately, was the rebuilding of the temple. In the second month of the second year of the return the foundation was laid with all the pomp which could be commanded. The efforts of the Samaritans were successful in putting a stop to the work during the seven remaining years of the reign of Cyrus and through the eight years of Cambyses and Smerdis. Nor does Zerubbabel appear quite blameless for this long delay. The difficulties in the way of building the temple were not such as need have stopped the work and during this long suspension of sixteen years Zerubbabel and the rest of the people had been busy in building costly houses for themselves. But in the second year of Darius, light dawned upon the darkness of the colony from Babylon. In that year", "it was the most memorable event in Zerabbabel's life", "the spirit of prophecy suddenly blazed up with a most brilliant light among the returned captives. Their words fell like sparks upon tinder. In a moment Zerubbabel roused from his apathy, threw his whole strength into the work. After much opposition [ NEHEMIAH, THE BOOK OF ] and many hindrances find delays, the temple was at length finished, in the sixth pear of Darius, and was dedicated with much pomp and rejoicing. [ TEMPLE ] The only other works of Zerubbabel of which we learn from Scripture are the restoration of the courses of priests and Levites and of the provision for their maintenance, according to the institution of David ( Ezra 6:18 ;  Nehemiah 12:47 ) the registering the returned captives according to their genealogies, ( Nehemiah 7:5 ) and the keeping of a Passover in the seventh year of Darius, with which last event ends all that we know of the life of Zerubbabel, His apocryphal history is told in 1 Esdr. 3-7. The exact parentage of Zerubbabel is a little obscure, from his being always called the son of Shealtiel, ( Ezra 3:2,8 ;  5:2 ) etc.; ( Haggai 1:1,12,14 ) etc., end appearing as such in the genealogies of Christ ( Matthew 1:12 ;  Luke 3:27 ) whereas in ( 1 Chronicles 3:19 ) he is represented as the son of Pedaiah, Shealtiel or Salathiel's brother, and consequently as Salathiel's nephew. Zerubbabel was the legal successor and heir of Jeconiah's royal estate, the grandson of Neri and the lineal descendant of Nathan the son of David.

It received its name from the \"first-born\" of Canaan, the grandson of Noah ( Genesis 10:15, 19 ). It was the first home of the Phoenicians on the coast of Palestine, and from its extensive commercial relations became a \"great\" city ( Joshua 11:8 ;  19:28 ). It was the mother city of Tyre. It lay within the lot of the tribe of Asher, but was never subdued ( Judges 1:31 ). The Zidonians long oppressed Israel ( Judges 10:12 ). From the time of David its glory began to wane, and Tyre, its \"virgin daughter\" ( Isaiah 23:12 ), rose to its place of pre-eminence. Solomon entered into a matrimonial alliance with the Zidonians, and thus their form of idolatrous worship found a place in the land of Israel ( 1 Kings 11:1, 33 ). This city was famous for its manufactures and arts, as well as for its commerce ( 1 Kings 5:6 ;  1 Chronicles 22:4 ;  Ezekiel 27:8 ). It is frequently referred to by the prophets ( Isaiah 23:2, 4, 12 ;  Jeremiah 25:22 ;  27:3 ;  47:4 ;  Ezekiel 27:8 ;  28:21, 22 ;  32:30 ;  Joel 3:4 ). Our Lord visited the \"coasts\" of Tyre and Zidon = Sidon (q.v.),  Matthew 15:21 ;  Mark 7:24 ;  Luke 4:26 ; and from this region many came forth to hear him preaching ( Mark 3:8 ;  Luke 6:17 ). From Sidon, at which the ship put in after leaving Caesarea, Paul finally sailed for Rome ( Acts 27:3, 4 ).", "This city is now a town of 10,000 inhabitants, with remains of walls built in the twelfth century A.D. In 1855, the sarcophagus of Eshmanezer was discovered. From a Phoenician inscription on its lid, it appears that he was a \"king of the Sidonians,\" probably in the third century B.C., and that his mother was a priestess of Ashtoreth, \"the goddess of the Sidonians.\" In this inscription Baal is mentioned as the chief god of the Sidonians."], "Word": "Zidon", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "2": {"Definitions": ["hunting; fishing; venison"], "Word": "Zidon", "Dictionary": "Hitchcock's Names Dictionary"}, "3": {"Definitions": ["See Sidon Sidon"], "Word": "Zidon", "Dictionary": "Naves Topical Index"}, "4": {"Definitions": ["( Genesis 10:15,19 ;  Joshua 11:8 ;  19:28 ;  Judges 1:31 ;  18:28 ;  Isaiah 23:2,4,12 ;  Jeremiah 25:22 ;  27:3 ;  Ezekiel 28:21,22 ;  Joel 3:4 ) ( Joel 4:4 );  Zechariah 9:2 ;  Matthew 11:21, 22 ;  15:21 ;  Mark 3:8 ;  1:24,31 ;  Luke 6:17 ;  10:13,14  An ancient and wealthy city of Phoenicia, on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, less than twenty English miles to the north of Tyre. Its Hebrew name,  Tsidon  , signifies  fishing  or  fishery  . Its modern name is  Saida  . It is situated in the narrow plain between the Lebanon and the sea. From a biblical point of view this city is inferior in interest to its neighbor Tyre; though in early times Sidon was the more influential of the two cities. This view is confirmed by Zidonians being used as the generic name of Phoenicians or Canaanites. ( Joshua 13:6 ;  Judges 18:7 ) From the time of Solomon to the invasion of Nebuchadnezzar Zidon is not often directly mentioned in the Bible, and it appears to have been subordinate to Tyre. When the people called \"Zidonians\" are mentioned, it sometimes seems that the Phoenicians of the plain of Zidon are meant. ( 1 Kings 5:6 ;  11:1,5,33 ;  16:31 ;  2 Kings 23:13 ) All that is known are respecting the city is very scanty, amounting to scarcely more than that one of its sources of gain was trade in slaves, in which the inhabitants did not shrink from selling inhabitants of Palestine and that it was governed by kings. ( Jeremiah 25:22 ;  27:3 ) During the Persian domination Zidon seems to have attained its highest point of prosperity; and it is recorded that, toward the close of that period, it far excelled all other Phoenician cities in wealth and importance. Its prosperity was suddenly cut short by an unsuccessful revolt against Persia, which ended in the destruction of the town, B.C. 351. Its king, Tennes had proved a traitor and betrayed the city to Ochus, king of the Persians; the Persian troops were admitted within the gates, and occupied the city walls. The Zidonians, before the arrival of Ochus, had burnt their vessels to prevent any one's leaving the town; and when they saw themselves surrounded by the Persian troops, they adopted the desperate resolution of shutting themselves up with their families, and setting fire each man to his own house. Forty thousand persons are said to have perished in the flames. Zidon however, gradually recovered from the blow, and became again a flourishing town. It is about fifty miles distant from Nazareth, and is the most northern city which is mentioned in connection with Christ's journeys. (The town  Saida  still shows signs of its former wealth, and its houses are better constructed and more solid than those of Tyre, many of them being built of stone; but it is a poor, miserable place, without trade or manufactures worthy of the name. The city that once divided with Tyre the empire of the seas is now almost without a vessel. Silk and fruit are its staple products. Its population is estimated at 10,000, 7000 of whom are Moslems, and the rest Catholics, Maronites and Protestants.", "McClintock and Strong's Cyclop'dia. There is a flourishing Protestant mission here.", "ED.)"], "Word": "Zidon, or Sidon", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "5": {"Definitions": ["the inhabitants of Zidon.

His original name was Mattaniah; but when Nebuchadnezzar placed him on the throne as the successor to Jehoiachin he changed his name to Zedekiah. The prophet Jeremiah was his counsellor, yet \"he did evil in the sight of the Lord\" ( 2 Kings 24:19, 20 ;  Jeremiah 52:2, 3 ). He ascended the throne at the age of twenty-one years. The kingdom was at that time tributary to Nebuchadnezzar; but, despite the strong remonstrances of Jeremiah and others, as well as the example of Jehoiachin, he threw off the yoke of Babylon, and entered into an alliance with Hophra, king of Egypt. This brought up Nebuchadnezzar, \"with all his host\" ( 2 Kings 25:1 ), against Jerusalem. During this siege, which lasted about eighteen months, \"every worst woe befell the devoted city, which drank the cup of God's fury to the dregs\" ( 2 Kings 25:3 ;  Lamentations 4:4, 5, 10 ). The city was plundered and laid in ruins. Zedekiah and his followers, attempting to escape, were made captive and taken to Riblah.
