( Exodus 29:21 ;  28:41 ) etc. The high priest had a peculiar dress, which passed to his successor at his death. This dress consisted of eight parts: (a) The  breastplate  , or, as it is further named, vs. ( Exodus 28:15,29,30 ) the breastplate of judgment.

They were further united by a \"curious girdle\" of gold blue purple, scarlet and fine twined linen round the waist. [EPHOD; GIRDLE] (C) The  robe of the ephod.  This was of inferior material to the ephod itself being all of blue, ver. 31, which implied its being only of \"woven work.\" ch.

The skirt of this robe had a remarkable trimming of pomegranates in blue, red and crimson, with a bell of gold between each pomegranate alternately. The bells were to give a sound when the high priest went in and came out of the holy place. (d) The  mitre  or  upper turbin,  with its gold plate, engraved with \"Holiness to the Lord,\" fastened to it by a ribbon of blue. (e) The broidered coat was a tunic or long skirt of linen with a tessellated or diaper pattern, like the setting of stone. (f) The  girdle  , also of linen, was wound round the body several times from the breast downward, and the ends hung down to the ankles. (g) The breeches or drawers, of linen, covered the loins and thighs; and (h) The bonnet was a turban of linen, partially covering the head, but not in the form of a cone like that of the high priest when the mitre was added to it. These last four were common to all priests.

The manslayer might not leave the city of refuge during the lifetime of the existing high priest. It was also forbidden to the high priest to follow a funeral, or rend his clothes for the dead. It does not appear by whose authority the high priests were appointed to their office before there were kings of Isr'l. After this the office seems to have been used for political rather than religious purposes. Though at first chosen for life, we find that Solomon deposed Abiathar, ( 1 Kings 2:35 ) and that Herod appointed a number of high priests, which may account for there being at least two living in Christ's time, Annas and Caiaphas.

Again, according to ( Leviticus 21:17-21 ) no one that had a blemish could officiate at the altar. The theological view of the high priesthood does not fall within the scope of this work. It must suffice therefore to indicate that such a view would embrace the consideration of the office, dress, functions and ministrations of the high priest considered as typical of the priesthood of our Lord Jesus Christ, and as setting forth under shadows the truths which are openly taught under the gospel.

In some parts of Palestine and Arabia stone is used, and in certain districts caves in the rocks are used as dwellings. ( Amos 5:11 ) The houses are usually of one story only, viz., the ground floor, and often contain only one apartment. Sometimes a small court for the cattle is attached; and in some cases the cattle are housed in the same building, or the live in a raised platform, and, the cattle round them on the ground. ( 1 Samuel 28:24 ) The windows are small apertures high up in the walls, sometimes grated with wood. The roofs are commonly but not always flat, and are usually formed of plaster of mud and straw laid upon boughs or rafters; and upon the flat roofs, tents or \"booths\" of boughs or rushes are often raised to be used as sleeping-places in summer. The difference between the poorest houses and those of the class next above them is greater than between these and the houses of the first rank. The prevailing plan of eastern houses of this class presents, as was the case in ancient Egypt, a front of wall, whose blank and mean appearance is usually relieved only by the door and a few latticed and projecting windows. Within this is a court or courts with apartments opening into them. Over the door is a projecting window with a lattice more or less elaborately wrought, which, except in times of public celebrations is usually closed. ( 2 Kings 9:30 ) An awning is sometimes drawn over the court, and the floor is strewed with carpets on festive occasions. The stairs to the upper apartments are in Syria usually in a corner of the court. Around part, if not the whole, of the court is a veranda, often nine or ten feet deep, over which, when there is more than one floor, runs a second gallery of like depth, with a balustrade. When there is no second floor, but more than one court, the women's apartments", "hareems, harem  or  haram", "are usually in the second court; otherwise they form a separate building within the general enclosure, or are above on the first floor. When there is an upper story, the  ka'ah  forms the most important apartment, and thus probably answers to the \"upper room,\" which was often the guest-chamber. ( Luke 22:12 ;  Acts 1:13 ;  9:37 ;  20:8 ) The windows of the upper rooms often project one or two feet, and form a kiosk or latticed chamber. Such may have been \"the chamber in the wall.\" ( 2 Kings 4:10,11 ) The \"lattice,\" through which Ahasiah fell, perhaps belonged to an upper chamber of this kind, ( 2 Kings 1:2 ) as also the \"third loft,\" from which Eutychus fell. ( Acts 20:9 ) comp.  Jeremiah 22:13  Paul preached in such a room on account of its superior rise and retired position. The outer circle in an audience in such a room sat upon a dais, or upon cushions elevated so as to be as high as the window-sill. From such a position Eutychus could easily fall. There are usually no special bed-rooms in eastern houses. The outer doors are closed with a wooden lock, but in some cases the apartments are divided from each other by curtains only. There are no chimneys, but fire is made when required with charcoal in a chafing-dish; or a fire of wood might be made in the open court of the house ( Luke 22:65 ) Some houses in Cairo have an apartment open in front to the court with two or more arches and a railing, and a pillar to support the wall above. It was in a chamber of this size to be found in a palace, that our Lord was being arraigned before the high priest at the time when the denial of him by St. Peter took place. He \"turned and looked\" on Peter as he stood by the fire in the court, ( Luke 22:56,61 ;  John 18:24 ) whilst he himself was in the \"hall of judgment.\" In no point do Oriental domestic habits differ more from European than in the use of the roof. Its flat surface is made useful for various household purposes, as drying corn, hanging up linen, and preparing figs and raisins. The roofs are used as places of recreation in the evening, and often as sleeping-places at night. ( 1 Samuel 9:25,26 ;  2 Samuel 11:2 ;  16:22 ;  Job 27:18 ;  Proverbs 21:9 ;  Daniel 4:29 ) They were also used as places for devotion and even idolatrous worship. ( 2 Kings 23:12 ;  Jeremiah 19:13 ;  32:29 ;  Zephaniah 1:6 ;  Acts 10:9 ) At the time of the feast of tabernacles booths were erected by the Jews on the top of their houses. Protection of the roof by parapets was enjoined by the law. ( 22:8 ) Special apartments were devoted in larger houses to winter and summer uses. ( Jeremiah 36:22 ;  Amos 3:15 ) The ivory house of Ahab was probably a palace largely ornamented with inlaid ivory. The circumstance of Samson's pulling down the house by means of the pillars may be explained by the fact of the company being assembled on tiers of balconies above each other, supported by central pillars on the basement; when these were pulled down the whole of the upper floors would fall also.

In some parts of Palestine and Arabia stone is used, and in certain districts caves in the rocks are used as dwellings. ( Amos 5:11 ) The houses are usually of one story only, viz., the ground floor, and often contain only one apartment. Sometimes a small court for the cattle is attached; and in some cases the cattle are housed in the same building, or the live in a raised platform, and, the cattle round them on the ground. ( 1 Samuel 28:24 ) The windows are small apertures high up in the walls, sometimes grated with wood. The roofs are commonly but not always flat, and are usually formed of plaster of mud and straw laid upon boughs or rafters; and upon the flat roofs, tents or \"booths\" of boughs or rushes are often raised to be used as sleeping-places in summer. The difference between the poorest houses and those of the class next above them is greater than between these and the houses of the first rank. The prevailing plan of eastern houses of this class presents, as was the case in ancient Egypt, a front of wall, whose blank and mean appearance is usually relieved only by the door and a few latticed and projecting windows. Within this is a court or courts with apartments opening into them. Over the door is a projecting window with a lattice more or less elaborately wrought, which, except in times of public celebrations is usually closed. ( 2 Kings 9:30 ) An awning is sometimes drawn over the court, and the floor is strewed with carpets on festive occasions. The stairs to the upper apartments are in Syria usually in a corner of the court. Around part, if not the whole, of the court is a veranda, often nine or ten feet deep, over which, when there is more than one floor, runs a second gallery of like depth, with a balustrade. When there is no second floor, but more than one court, the women's apartments", "hareems, harem  or  haram", "are usually in the second court; otherwise they form a separate building within the general enclosure, or are above on the first floor. When there is an upper story, the  ka'ah  forms the most important apartment, and thus probably answers to the \"upper room,\" which was often the guest-chamber. ( Luke 22:12 ;  Acts 1:13 ;  9:37 ;  20:8 ) The windows of the upper rooms often project one or two feet, and form a kiosk or latticed chamber. Such may have been \"the chamber in the wall.\" ( 2 Kings 4:10,11 ) The \"lattice,\" through which Ahasiah fell, perhaps belonged to an upper chamber of this kind, ( 2 Kings 1:2 ) as also the \"third loft,\" from which Eutychus fell. ( Acts 20:9 ) comp.  Jeremiah 22:13  Paul preached in such a room on account of its superior rise and retired position. The outer circle in an audience in such a room sat upon a dais, or upon cushions elevated so as to be as high as the window-sill. From such a position Eutychus could easily fall. There are usually no special bed-rooms in eastern houses. The outer doors are closed with a wooden lock, but in some cases the apartments are divided from each other by curtains only. There are no chimneys, but fire is made when required with charcoal in a chafing-dish; or a fire of wood might be made in the open court of the house ( Luke 22:65 ) Some houses in Cairo have an apartment open in front to the court with two or more arches and a railing, and a pillar to support the wall above. It was in a chamber of this size to be found in a palace, that our Lord was being arraigned before the high priest at the time when the denial of him by St. Peter took place. He \"turned and looked\" on Peter as he stood by the fire in the court, ( Luke 22:56,61 ;  John 18:24 ) whilst he himself was in the \"hall of judgment.\" In no point do Oriental domestic habits differ more from European than in the use of the roof. Its flat surface is made useful for various household purposes, as drying corn, hanging up linen, and preparing figs and raisins. The roofs are used as places of recreation in the evening, and often as sleeping-places at night. ( 1 Samuel 9:25,26 ;  2 Samuel 11:2 ;  16:22 ;  Job 27:18 ;  Proverbs 21:9 ;  Daniel 4:29 ) They were also used as places for devotion and even idolatrous worship. ( 2 Kings 23:12 ;  Jeremiah 19:13 ;  32:29 ;  Zephaniah 1:6 ;  Acts 10:9 ) At the time of the feast of tabernacles booths were erected by the Jews on the top of their houses. Protection of the roof by parapets was enjoined by the law. ( 22:8 ) Special apartments were devoted in larger houses to winter and summer uses. ( Jeremiah 36:22 ;  Amos 3:15 ) The ivory house of Ahab was probably a palace largely ornamented with inlaid ivory. The circumstance of Samson's pulling down the house by means of the pillars may be explained by the fact of the company being assembled on tiers of balconies above each other, supported by central pillars on the basement; when these were pulled down the whole of the upper floors would fall also.

( Exodus 29:21 ;  28:41 ) etc. The high priest had a peculiar dress, which passed to his successor at his death. This dress consisted of eight parts: (a) The  breastplate  , or, as it is further named, vs. ( Exodus 28:15,29,30 ) the breastplate of judgment. The breastplate was originally two spans long and one span broad, but when doubled it was square, the shape in which it was worn.

(b) The  ephod  . This consisted of two parts, of which one covered the back and the other the front, i.e. the breast and upper part of the body. These parts were clasped together on the shoulder with two large onyx stones, each having engraved on it six of the names of the tribes of Isr'l. They were further united by a \"curious girdle\" of gold blue purple, scarlet and fine twined linen round the waist. [EPHOD; GIRDLE] (C) The  robe of the ephod.  This was of inferior material to the ephod itself being all of blue, ver. 31, which implied its being only of \"woven work.\" ch. ( Exodus 39:22 ) It was worn immediately under the ephod, and was longer than it. The skirt of this robe had a remarkable trimming of pomegranates in blue, red and crimson, with a bell of gold between each pomegranate alternately. The bells were to give a sound when the high priest went in and came out of the holy place. (d) The  mitre  or  upper turbin,  with its gold plate, engraved with \"Holiness to the Lord,\" fastened to it by a ribbon of blue. (e) The broidered coat was a tunic or long skirt of linen with a tessellated or diaper pattern, like the setting of stone. (f) The  girdle  , also of linen, was wound round the body several times from the breast downward, and the ends hung down to the ankles. (g) The breeches or drawers, of linen, covered the loins and thighs; and (h) The bonnet was a turban of linen, partially covering the head, but not in the form of a cone like that of the high priest when the mitre was added to it. These last four were common to all priests. The high priest alone was permitted to enter the holy of holies, which he did once a year, on the great day of atonement, when he sprinkled the blood of the sin offering on the mercy seat, and burnt incense within the veil ( Leviticus 16:1 ) ... The manslayer might not leave the city of refuge during the lifetime of the existing high priest. It was also forbidden to the high priest to follow a funeral, or rend his clothes for the dead. It does not appear by whose authority the high priests were appointed to their office before there were kings of Isr'l. After this the office seems to have been used for political rather than religious purposes. Though at first chosen for life, we find that Solomon deposed Abiathar, ( 1 Kings 2:35 ) and that Herod appointed a number of high priests, which may account for there being at least two living in Christ's time, Annas and Caiaphas. ( Luke 3:2 ) The usual are for entering upon the functions of the priesthood, according to ( 2 Chronicles 31:17 ) is considered to have been 20 years, though a priest or high priest was not actually incapacitated if he had attained to puberty. Again, according to ( Leviticus 21:17-21 ) no one that had a blemish could officiate at the altar. The theological view of the high priesthood does not fall within the scope of this work. It must suffice therefore to indicate that such a view would embrace the consideration of the office, dress, functions and ministrations of the high priest considered as typical of the priesthood of our Lord Jesus Christ, and as setting forth under shadows the truths which are openly taught under the gospel. This had been done to a great extent in the Epistle to the Hebrews. It would also embrace all the moral and spiritual teaching supposed to be intended by such symbols."], "Word": "High Places6813 Priest", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "5": {"Definitions": ["Aaron was the first who was solemnly set apart to this office ( Exodus 29:7 ;  30:23 ;  Leviticus 8:12 ).

In this line it continued to Abiathar, whom Solomon deposed, and appointed Zadok, of the family of Eleazar, in his stead ( 1 Kings 2:35 ), in which it remained till the time of the Captivity.

(e) The broidered coat was a tunic or long skirt of linen with a tessellated or diaper pattern, like the setting of stone. (f) The  girdle  , also of linen, was wound round the body several times from the breast downward, and the ends hung down to the ankles. (g) The breeches or drawers, of linen, covered the loins and thighs; and (h) The bonnet was a turban of linen, partially covering the head, but not in the form of a cone like that of the high priest when the mitre was added to it. These last four were common to all priests. The high priest alone was permitted to enter the holy of holies, which he did once a year, on the great day of atonement, when he sprinkled the blood of the sin offering on the mercy seat, and burnt incense within the veil ( Leviticus 16:1 ) ... The manslayer might not leave the city of refuge during the lifetime of the existing high priest. It was also forbidden to the high priest to follow a funeral, or rend his clothes for the dead. It does not appear by whose authority the high priests were appointed to their office before there were kings of Isr'l. After this the office seems to have been used for political rather than religious purposes. Though at first chosen for life, we find that Solomon deposed Abiathar, ( 1 Kings 2:35 ) and that Herod appointed a number of high priests, which may account for there being at least two living in Christ's time, Annas and Caiaphas. ( Luke 3:2 ) The usual are for entering upon the functions of the priesthood, according to ( 2 Chronicles 31:17 ) is considered to have been 20 years, though a priest or high priest was not actually incapacitated if he had attained to puberty. Again, according to ( Leviticus 21:17-21 ) no one that had a blemish could officiate at the altar. The theological view of the high priesthood does not fall within the scope of this work. It must suffice therefore to indicate that such a view would embrace the consideration of the office, dress, functions and ministrations of the high priest considered as typical of the priesthood of our Lord Jesus Christ, and as setting forth under shadows the truths which are openly taught under the gospel. This had been done to a great extent in the Epistle to the Hebrews. It would also embrace all the moral and spiritual teaching supposed to be intended by such symbols."], "Word": "High Places6813 Priest", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "5": {"Definitions": ["Aaron was the first who was solemnly set apart to this office ( Exodus 29:7 ;  30:23 ;  Leviticus 8:12 ). He wore a peculiar dress, which on his death passed to his successor in office ( Exodus 29:29, 30 ). Besides those garments which he wore in common with all priests, there were four that were peculiar to himself as high priest-", "1.  The \"robe\" of the ephod, all of blue, of \"woven work,\" worn immediately under the ephod. It was without seam or sleeves. The hem or skirt was ornamented with pomegranates and golden bells, seventy-two of each in alternate order. The sounding of the bells intimated to the people in the outer court the time when the high priest entered into the holy place to burn incense before the Lord ( Exodus 28 ).", "2.  The \"ephod\" consisted of two parts, one of which covered the back and the other the breast, which were united by the \"curious girdle.\" It was made of fine twined linen, and ornamented with gold and purple. Each of the shoulder-straps was adorned with a precious stone, on which the names of the twelve tribes were engraved. This was the high priest's distinctive vestment ( 1 Samuel 2:28 ;  14:3 ;  21:9 ;  23:6, 9 ;  30:7 ).", "3.  The \"breastplate of judgment\" ( Exodus 28:6-12, 25-28 ;  39:2-7 ) of \"cunning work.\" It was a piece of cloth doubled, of one span square. It bore twelve precious stones, set in four rows of three in a row, which constituted the Urim and Thummim (q.v.). These stones had the names of the twelve tribes engraved on them. When the high priest, clothed with the ephod and the breastplate, inquired of the Lord, answers were given in some mysterious way by the Urim and Thummim ( 1 Samuel 14:3, 18, 19 ;  23:2, 4, 9, 11, 12 ;  28:6 ;  2 Samuel 5:23 ).", "4.

Wearing his gorgeous priestly vestments, he entered the temple before all the people, and then, laying them aside and assuming only his linen garments in secret, he entered the holy of holies alone, and made expiation, sprinkling the blood of the sin offering on the mercy seat, and offering up incense. Then resuming his splendid robes, he reappeared before the people (Leviticus 16). Thus the wearing of these robes came to be identified with the Day of Atonement.", "The office, dress, and ministration of the high priest were typical of the priesthood of our Lord ( Hebrews 4:14 ;  7:25 ;  9:12 , etc.).", "It is supposed that there were in all eighty-three high priests, beginning with Aaron (B.C. 1657) and ending with Phannias (A.D. 70). At its first institution the office of high priest was held for life (but comp.  1 Kings 2:27 ), and was hereditary in the family of Aaron ( Numbers 3:10 ). The office continued in the line of Eleazar, Aaron's eldest son, for two hundred and ninety-six years, when it passed to Eli, the first of the line of Ithamar, who was the fourth son of Aaron. In this line it continued to Abiathar, whom Solomon deposed, and appointed Zadok, of the family of Eleazar, in his stead ( 1 Kings 2:35 ), in which it remained till the time of the Captivity. After the Return, Joshua, the son of Josedek, of the family of Eleazar, was appointed to this office.

Meaning of words in the original, (a) The usual Hebrew word for \"heavens\" is shamayim, a plural form meaning \"heights,\" \"elevations\" ( Genesis 1:1 ;  2:1 ).

Its earlier name was Kirjath-arba ( Genesis 23:2 ;  Joshua 14:15 ;  15:3 ). But \"Hebron would appear to have been the original name of the city, and it was not till after Abraham's stay there that it received the name Kirjath-arba, who [i.e., Arba] was not the founder but the conqueror of the city, having led thither the tribe of the Anakim, to which he belonged. It retained this name till it came into the possession of Caleb, when the Israelites restored the original name Hebron\" (Keil, Com.). The name of this city does not occur in any of the prophets or in the New Testament. It is found about forty times in the Old. It was the favorite home of Abraham. Here he pitched his tent under the oaks of Mamre, by which name it came afterwards to be known; and here Sarah died, and was buried in the cave of Machpelah ( Genesis 23:17-20 ), which he bought from Ephron the Hittite. From this place the patriarch departed for Egypt by way of Beersheba ( 37:14 ;  46:1 ). It was taken by Joshua and given to Caleb ( Joshua 10:36, 37 ;  12:10 ;  14:13 ). It became a Levitical city and a city of refuge ( 20:7 ;  21:11 ). When David became king of Judah this was his royal residence, and he resided here for seven and a half years ( 2 Samuel 5:5 ); and here he was anointed as king over all Israel ( 2 Samuel 2:1-4, 11 ;  1 Kings 2:11 ).

A city in the south end of the valley of Eshcol, about midway between Jerusalem and Beersheba, from which it is distant about 20 miles in a straight line. It was built \"seven years before Zoan in Egypt\" ( Genesis 13:18 ;  Numbers 13:22 ). It still exists under the same name, and is one of the most ancient cities in the world. Its earlier name was Kirjath-arba ( Genesis 23:2 ;  Joshua 14:15 ;  15:3 ). But \"Hebron would appear to have been the original name of the city, and it was not till after Abraham's stay there that it received the name Kirjath-arba, who [i.e., Arba] was not the founder but the conqueror of the city, having led thither the tribe of the Anakim, to which he belonged. It retained this name till it came into the possession of Caleb, when the Israelites restored the original name Hebron\" (Keil, Com.). The name of this city does not occur in any of the prophets or in the New Testament. It is found about forty times in the Old. It was the favorite home of Abraham. Here he pitched his tent under the oaks of Mamre, by which name it came afterwards to be known; and here Sarah died, and was buried in the cave of Machpelah ( Genesis 23:17-20 ), which he bought from Ephron the Hittite. From this place the patriarch departed for Egypt by way of Beersheba ( 37:14 ;  46:1 ). It was taken by Joshua and given to Caleb ( Joshua 10:36, 37 ;  12:10 ;  14:13 ). It became a Levitical city and a city of refuge ( 20:7 ;  21:11 ). When David became king of Judah this was his royal residence, and he resided here for seven and a half years ( 2 Samuel 5:5 ); and here he was anointed as king over all Israel ( 2 Samuel 2:1-4, 11 ;  1 Kings 2:11 ). It became the residence also of the rebellious Absalom ( 2 Samuel 15:10 ), who probably expected to find his chief support in the tribe of Judah, now called el-Khulil.", "In one part of the modern city is a great mosque, which is built over the grave of Machpelah. The first European who was permitted to enter this mosque was the Prince of Wales in 1862. It was also visited by the Marquis of Bute in 1866, and by the late Emperor Frederick of Germany (then Crown-Prince of Prussia) in 1869.", "One of the largest oaks in Palestine is found in the valley of Eshcol, about 3 miles north of the town.

Son of Ahaz ( 2 Kings 18:1 ;  2 Chronicles 29:1 ), whom he succeeded on the throne of the kingdom of Judah. He reigned twenty-nine years (B.C. 726-697). The history of this king is contained in  2 Kings 18:20 ,  Isaiah 36-39 , and  2 Chronicles 29-32 . He is spoken of as a great and good king. In public life he followed the example of his great-granfather Uzziah. He set himself to abolish idolatry from his kingdom, and among other things which he did for this end, he destroyed the \"brazen serpent,\" which had been removed to Jerusalem, and had become an object of idolatrous worship ( Numbers 21:9 ). A great reformation was wrought in the kingdom of Judah in his day ( 2 Kings 18:4 ;  2 Chronicles 29:3-36 ).", "On the death of Sargon and the accession of his son Sennacherib to the throne of Assyria, Hezekiah refused to pay the tribute which his father had paid, and \"rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not,\" but entered into a league with Egypt ( Isaiah 30; 31 ;  36:6-9 ). This led to the invasion of Judah by Sennacherib ( 2 Kings 18:13-16 ), who took forty cities, and besieged Jerusalem with mounds. Hezekiah yielded to the demands of the Assyrian king, and agreed to pay him three hundred talents of silver and thirty of gold ( 18:14 ).", "But Sennacherib dealt treacherously with Hezekiah ( Isaiah 33:1 ), and a second time within two years invaded his kingdom ( 2 Kings 18:17 ;  2 Chronicles 32:9 ;  Isaiah 36 ). This invasion issued in the destruction of Sennacherib's army. Hezekiah prayed to God, and \"that night the angel of the Lord went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians 185,000 men.\" Sennacherib fled with the shattered remnant of his forces to Nineveh, where, seventeen years after, he was assassinated by his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer ( 2 Kings 19:37 ). (See  SENNACHERIB .)", "The narrative of Hezekiah's sickness and miraculous recovery is found in  2 Kings 20:1 ,  2 Chronicles 32:24 ,  Isaiah 38:1 . Various ambassadors came to congratulate him on his recovery, and among them Merodach-baladan, the viceroy of Babylon ( 2 Chronicles 32:23 ;  2 Kings 20:12 ).

The history of this king is contained in  2 Kings 18:20 ,  Isaiah 36-39 , and  2 Chronicles 29-32 . He is spoken of as a great and good king. In public life he followed the example of his great-granfather Uzziah. He set himself to abolish idolatry from his kingdom, and among other things which he did for this end, he destroyed the \"brazen serpent,\" which had been removed to Jerusalem, and had become an object of idolatrous worship ( Numbers 21:9 ). A great reformation was wrought in the kingdom of Judah in his day ( 2 Kings 18:4 ;  2 Chronicles 29:3-36 ).", "On the death of Sargon and the accession of his son Sennacherib to the throne of Assyria, Hezekiah refused to pay the tribute which his father had paid, and \"rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not,\" but entered into a league with Egypt ( Isaiah 30; 31 ;  36:6-9 ). This led to the invasion of Judah by Sennacherib ( 2 Kings 18:13-16 ), who took forty cities, and besieged Jerusalem with mounds. Hezekiah yielded to the demands of the Assyrian king, and agreed to pay him three hundred talents of silver and thirty of gold ( 18:14 ).", "But Sennacherib dealt treacherously with Hezekiah ( Isaiah 33:1 ), and a second time within two years invaded his kingdom ( 2 Kings 18:17 ;  2 Chronicles 32:9 ;  Isaiah 36 ). This invasion issued in the destruction of Sennacherib's army. Hezekiah prayed to God, and \"that night the angel of the Lord went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians 185,000 men.\" Sennacherib fled with the shattered remnant of his forces to Nineveh, where, seventeen years after, he was assassinated by his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer ( 2 Kings 19:37 ).

Exodus 13:10 ). On occasion of one of these \"yearly\" visits, being grieved by reason of Peninnah's conduct toward her, she went forth alone, and kneeling before the Lord at the sanctuary she prayed inaudibly. Eli the high priest, who sat at the entrance to the holy place, observed her, and misunderstanding her character he harshly condemned her conduct ( 1 Samuel 1:14-16 ). After hearing her explanation he retracted his injurious charge and said to her, \"Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition.\" Perhaps the story of the wife of Manoah was not unknown to her. Thereafter Elkanah and his family retired to their quiet home, and there, before another Passover, Hannah gave birth to a son, whom, in grateful memory of the Lord's goodness, she called Samuel, i.e., \"heard of God.\" After the child was weaned (probably in his third year) she brought him to Shiloh into the house of the Lord, and said to Eli the aged priest, \"Oh my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the Lord. For this child I prayed; and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of him: therefore I also have granted him to the Lord; as long as he liveth he is granted to the Lord\" ( 1 Samuel 1:27, 28 , R.V.).

Their rulers were the Hyksos, or shepherd kings. They were at length finally driven out of Egypt. Rameses II. sought vengeance against the \"vile Kheta,\" as he called them, and encountered and defeated them in the great battle of Kadesh, four centuries after Abraham. (See  JOSHUA .)", "They are first referred to in Scripture in the history of Abraham, who bought from Ephron the Hittite the field and the cave of Machpelah ( Genesis 15:20 -  23:3-18 ). They were then settled at Kirjath-arba. From this tribe Esau took his first two wives ( 26:34 ;  36:2 ).", "They are afterwards mentioned in the usual way among the inhabitants of the Promised Land ( Exodus 23:28 ). They were closely allied to the Amorites, and are frequently mentioned along with them as inhabiting the mountains of Palestine. When the spies entered the land they seem to have occupied with the Amorites the mountain region of Judah ( Numbers 13:29 ). They took part with the other Canaanites against the Israelites ( Joshua 9:1 ;  11:3 ).", "After this there are few references to them in Scripture. Mention is made of \"Ahimelech the Hittite\" ( 1 Samuel 26:6 ), and of \"Uriah the Hittite,\" one of David's chief officers ( 2 Samuel 23:39 ;  1 Chronicles 11:41 ). In the days of Solomon they were a powerful confederation in the north of Syria, and were ruled by \"kings.\" They are met with after the Exile still a distinct people ( Ezra 9:1 ; comp.  Nehemiah 13:23-28 ).", "The Hebrew merchants exported horses from Egypt not only for the kings of Israel, but also for the Hittites ( 1 Kings 10:28, 29 ). From the Egyptian monuments we learn that \"the Hittites were a people with yellow skins and Mongoloid' features, whose receding foreheads, oblique eyes, and protruding upper jaws are represented as faithfully on their own monuments as they are on those of Egypt, so that we cannot accuse the Egyptian artists of caricaturing their enemies. The Amorites, on the contrary, were a tall and handsome people. They are depicted with white skins, blue eyes, and reddish hair, all the characteristics, in fact, of the white race\" (Sayce's The Hittites).

It really means the place of the dead, the unseen world, without deciding whether it be the place of misery or of happiness. It is clear that in many passages of the Old Testament  Sheol  can only mean \"the grave,\" and is rendered in the Authorized Version; see, for example, ( Genesis 37:35 ;  42:38 ;  1 Samuel 2:6 ;  Job 14:13 ) In other passages, however, it seems to Involve a notion of punishment, and is therefore rendered in the Authorized Version by the word \"hell.\" But in many cases this translation misleads the reader. In the New Testament \"hell\" is the translation of two words,  Hades  and  Gehenna  . The word  Hades  , like  Sheol  sometimes means merely \"the grave,\" ( Acts 2:31 ;  1 Corinthians 15:55 ;  Revelation 20:13 ) or in general \"the unseen world.\" It is in this sense that the creeds say of our Lord, \"He went down into hell,\" meaning the state of the dead in general, without any restriction of happiness or misery. Elsewhere in the New Testament Hades is used of a place of torment, ( Matthew 11:23 ;  Luke 16:23 ;  2 Peter 2:4 ) etc.; consequently it has been the prevalent, almost the universal, notion that Hades is an  intermediate state  between death and resurrection, divided into two parts one the abode of the blest and the other of the lost. It is used eleven times in the New Testament, and only once translated \"grave.\" ( 1 Corinthians 15:55 ) The word most frequently used (occurring twelve times) in the New Testament for the place of future punishment is  Gehenna  or  Gehenna of fire  . This was originally the valley of Hinnom, south of Jerusalem, where the filth and dead animals of the city were cast out and burned; a fit symbol of the wicked and their destruction.

The Egyptians let the hair of their head and beard grow only when they were in mourning, shaving it off at other times. \"So particular were they on this point that to have neglected it was a subject of reproach and ridicule; and whenever they intended to convey the idea of a man of low condition, or a slovenly person, the artists represented him with a beard.\" Joseph shaved himself before going in to Pharoah ( Genesis 41:14 ). The women of Egypt wore their hair long and plaited. Wigs were worn by priests and laymen to cover the shaven skull, and false beards were common. The great masses of hair seen in the portraits and statues of kings and priests are thus altogether artificial.", "2.  A precisely opposite practice, as regards men, prevailed among the Assyrians. In Assyrian sculptures the hair always appears long, and combed closely down upon the head. The beard also was allowed to grow to its full length.", "3.  Among the Greeks the custom in this respect varied at different times, as it did also among the Romans. In the time of the apostle, among the Greeks the men wore short hair, while that of the women was long ( 1 Corinthians 11:14, 15 ). Paul reproves the Corinthians for falling in with a style of manners which so far confounded the distinction of the sexes and was hurtful to good morals. (See, however,  1 Timothy 2:9 , and  1 Peter 3:3 , as regards women.)", "4.  Among the Hebrews the natural distinction between the sexes was preserved by the women wearing long hair ( Luke 7:38 ;  John 11:2 ;  1 Corinthians 11:6 ), while the men preserved theirs as a rule at a moderate length by frequent clipping.", "Baldness disqualified any one for the priest's office ( Leviticus 21 ).", "Elijah is called a \"hairy man\" ( 2 Kings 1:8 ) from his flowing locks, or more probably from the shaggy cloak of hair which he wore.

Tearing the hair and letting it go dishevelled were also tokens of grief ( Ezra 9:3 ). \"Cutting off the hair\" is a figure of the entire destruction of a people ( Isaiah 7:20 ). The Hebrews anointed the hair profusely with fragrant ointments ( Ruth 3:3 ;  2 Samuel 14:2 ;  Psalms 23:5 ;  45:7 , etc.), especially in seasons of rejoicing ( Matthew 6:17 ;  Luke 7:46 )."], "Word": "Hair", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "2": {"Definitions": ["Numbered Matthew 10:30 ;  Luke 12:7", "Worn long by women Isaiah 3:24 ;  Luke 7:38 ;  1 Corinthians 11:5-6 ;  1 Corinthians 11:15 ;  1 Timothy 2:9 ;  1 Peter 3:3 ;  Revelation 9:8", "Worn long by Absalom 2 Samuel 14:26", "Worn short by men 1 Corinthians 11:14", "Symbolic, dividing of Ezekiel 5:1-2 Baldness ;  Caul ;  Leprosy ;  Mourning ;  Nazarite"], "Word": "Hair", "Dictionary": "Naves Topical Index"}, "3": {"Definitions": ["The Hebrews were fully alive to the importance of the hair as an element of personal beauty.

The usual and favorite color of the hair was black, ( Solomon 5:11 ) as is indicated in the comparisons in ( Solomon 1:5 ;  4:1 ) a similar hue is probably intended by the  purple  of ( Solomon 7:6 ) Pure white hair was deemed characteristic of the divine Majesty. ( Daniel 7:9 ;  Revelation 1:14 ) The chief beauty of the hair consisted in curls, whether of a natural or an artificial character. With regard to the mode of dressing the hair, we have no very precise information; the terms used are of a general character, as of Jezebel, ( 2 Kings 9:30 ) and of Judith, ch. 10.3, and in the New Testament, ( 1 Timothy 2:9 ;  1 Peter 3:3 ) The arrangement of Samson's hair into seven locks, or more properly braids, ( Judges 16:13,19 ) involves the practice of plaiting, which was also familiar to the Egyptians and Greeks. The locks were probably kept in their place by a fillet, as in Egypt. The Hebrews like other nations of antiquity, anointed the hair profusely with ointments, which were generally compounded of various aromatic ingredients, ( Ruth 3:3 ;  2 Samuel 14:2 ;  Psalms 23:6 ;  92:10 ;  Ecclesiastes 9:8 ) more especially on occasions of festivity or hospitality.

Its canonicity. All the results of critical and historical research to which this epistle has been specially subjected abundantly vindicate its right to a place in the New Testament canon among the other inspired books.", "2.  Its authorship. A considerable variety of opinions on this subject has at different times been advanced. Some have maintained that its author was Silas, Paul's companion. Others have attributed it to Clement of Rome, or Luke, or Barnabas, or some unknown Alexandrian Christian, or Apollos; but the conclusion which we think is best supported, both from internal and external evidence, is that Paul was its author. There are, no doubt, many difficulties in the way of accepting it as Paul's; but we may at least argue with Calvin that there can be no difficulty in the way of \"embracing it without controversy as one of the apostolical epistles.\"", "3.  Date and place of writing. It was in all probability written at Rome, near the close of Paul's two years' imprisonment ( Hebrews 13:19, 24 ). It was certainly written before the destruction of Jerusalem ( 13:10 ).", "4.  To whom addressed. Plainly it was intended for Jewish converts to the faith of the gospel, probably for the church at Jerusalem. The subscription of this epistle is, of course, without authority. In this case it is incorrect, for obviously Timothy could not be the bearer of it ( 13:23 ).", "5.  Its design was to show the true end and meaning of the Mosaic system, and its symbolical and transient character. It proves that the Levitical priesthood was a \"shadow\" of that of Christ, and that the legal sacrifices prefigured the great and all-perfect sacrifice he offered for us. It explains that the gospel was designed, not to modify the law of Moses, but to supersede and abolish it. Its teaching was fitted, as it was designed, to check that tendency to apostatize from Christianity and to return to Judaism which now showed itself among certain Jewish Christians. The supreme authority and the transcendent glory of the gospel are clearly set forth, and in such a way as to strengthen and confirm their allegiance to Christ.", "6.  It consists of two parts- (a) doctrinal ( 1-10:18 ), (b) and practical ( 10:19-ch. 13 ). There are found in it many references to portions of the Old Testament.

We find from the very first the following characteristic attributes of Aaron and the high priests his successors, as distinguished from the other priests: Aaron alone was anointed, ( Leviticus 8:12 ) whence one of the distinctive epithets of the high priest was \"the anointed priest.\" ( Leviticus 4:3,5,16 ;  21:10 ) see ( Numbers 35:25 ) The anointing of the sons of Aaron, i.e. the common priests seems to have been confined to sprinkling their garments with the anointing oil. ( Exodus 29:21 ;  28:41 ) etc. The high priest had a peculiar dress, which passed to his successor at his death. This dress consisted of eight parts: (a) The  breastplate  , or, as it is further named, vs. ( Exodus 28:15,29,30 ) the breastplate of judgment. The breastplate was originally two spans long and one span broad, but when doubled it was square, the shape in which it was worn.

(b) The  ephod  . This consisted of two parts, of which one covered the back and the other the front, i.e. the breast and upper part of the body. These parts were clasped together on the shoulder with two large onyx stones, each having engraved on it six of the names of the tribes of Isr'l. They were further united by a \"curious girdle\" of gold blue purple, scarlet and fine twined linen round the waist. [EPHOD; GIRDLE] (C) The  robe of the ephod.  This was of inferior material to the ephod itself being all of blue, ver. 31, which implied its being only of \"woven work.\" ch. ( Exodus 39:22 ) It was worn immediately under the ephod, and was longer than it. The skirt of this robe had a remarkable trimming of pomegranates in blue, red and crimson, with a bell of gold between each pomegranate alternately. The bells were to give a sound when the high priest went in and came out of the holy place. (d) The  mitre  or  upper turbin,  with its gold plate, engraved with \"Holiness to the Lord,\" fastened to it by a ribbon of blue. (e) The broidered coat was a tunic or long skirt of linen with a tessellated or diaper pattern, like the setting of stone. (f) The  girdle  , also of linen, was wound round the body several times from the breast downward, and the ends hung down to the ankles. (g) The breeches or drawers, of linen, covered the loins and thighs; and (h) The bonnet was a turban of linen, partially covering the head, but not in the form of a cone like that of the high priest when the mitre was added to it. These last four were common to all priests. The high priest alone was permitted to enter the holy of holies, which he did once a year, on the great day of atonement, when he sprinkled the blood of the sin offering on the mercy seat, and burnt incense within the veil ( Leviticus 16:1 ) ... The manslayer might not leave the city of refuge during the lifetime of the existing high priest. It was also forbidden to the high priest to follow a funeral, or rend his clothes for the dead. It does not appear by whose authority the high priests were appointed to their office before there were kings of Isr'l. After this the office seems to have been used for political rather than religious purposes. Though at first chosen for life, we find that Solomon deposed Abiathar, ( 1 Kings 2:35 ) and that Herod appointed a number of high priests, which may account for there being at least two living in Christ's time, Annas and Caiaphas. ( Luke 3:2 ) The usual are for entering upon the functions of the priesthood, according to ( 2 Chronicles 31:17 ) is considered to have been 20 years, though a priest or high priest was not actually incapacitated if he had attained to puberty. Again, according to ( Leviticus 21:17-21 ) no one that had a blemish could officiate at the altar. The theological view of the high priesthood does not fall within the scope of this work. It must suffice therefore to indicate that such a view would embrace the consideration of the office, dress, functions and ministrations of the high priest considered as typical of the priesthood of our Lord Jesus Christ, and as setting forth under shadows the truths which are openly taught under the gospel. This had been done to a great extent in the Epistle to the Hebrews. It would also embrace all the moral and spiritual teaching supposed to be intended by such symbols."], "Word": "High Places6813 Priest", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "5": {"Definitions": ["Aaron was the first who was solemnly set apart to this office ( Exodus 29:7 ;  30:23 ;  Leviticus 8:12 ).

When the high priest, clothed with the ephod and the breastplate, inquired of the Lord, answers were given in some mysterious way by the Urim and Thummim ( 1 Samuel 14:3, 18, 19 ;  23:2, 4, 9, 11, 12 ;  28:6 ;  2 Samuel 5:23 ).", "4.

The office continued in the line of Eleazar, Aaron's eldest son, for two hundred and ninety-six years, when it passed to Eli, the first of the line of Ithamar, who was the fourth son of Aaron. In this line it continued to Abiathar, whom Solomon deposed, and appointed Zadok, of the family of Eleazar, in his stead ( 1 Kings 2:35 ), in which it remained till the time of the Captivity.

We find from the very first the following characteristic attributes of Aaron and the high priests his successors, as distinguished from the other priests: Aaron alone was anointed, ( Leviticus 8:12 ) whence one of the distinctive epithets of the high priest was \"the anointed priest.\" ( Leviticus 4:3,5,16 ;  21:10 ) see ( Numbers 35:25 ) The anointing of the sons of Aaron, i.e. the common priests seems to have been confined to sprinkling their garments with the anointing oil. ( Exodus 29:21 ;  28:41 ) etc. The high priest had a peculiar dress, which passed to his successor at his death. This dress consisted of eight parts: (a) The  breastplate  , or, as it is further named, vs. ( Exodus 28:15,29,30 ) the breastplate of judgment. The breastplate was originally two spans long and one span broad, but when doubled it was square, the shape in which it was worn. On it were the twelve precious stones, set in four rows, three in a row, thus corresponding to the twelve tribes", "each stone having the name of one of the children of Isr'l engraved upon it. (b) The  ephod  . This consisted of two parts, of which one covered the back and the other the front, i.e. the breast and upper part of the body. These parts were clasped together on the shoulder with two large onyx stones, each having engraved on it six of the names of the tribes of Isr'l. They were further united by a \"curious girdle\" of gold blue purple, scarlet and fine twined linen round the waist. [EPHOD; GIRDLE] (C) The  robe of the ephod.  This was of inferior material to the ephod itself being all of blue, ver. 31, which implied its being only of \"woven work.\" ch. ( Exodus 39:22 ) It was worn immediately under the ephod, and was longer than it. The skirt of this robe had a remarkable trimming of pomegranates in blue, red and crimson, with a bell of gold between each pomegranate alternately. The bells were to give a sound when the high priest went in and came out of the holy place. (d) The  mitre  or  upper turbin,  with its gold plate, engraved with \"Holiness to the Lord,\" fastened to it by a ribbon of blue. (e) The broidered coat was a tunic or long skirt of linen with a tessellated or diaper pattern, like the setting of stone. (f) The  girdle  , also of linen, was wound round the body several times from the breast downward, and the ends hung down to the ankles. (g) The breeches or drawers, of linen, covered the loins and thighs; and (h) The bonnet was a turban of linen, partially covering the head, but not in the form of a cone like that of the high priest when the mitre was added to it. These last four were common to all priests. The high priest alone was permitted to enter the holy of holies, which he did once a year, on the great day of atonement, when he sprinkled the blood of the sin offering on the mercy seat, and burnt incense within the veil ( Leviticus 16:1 ) ... The manslayer might not leave the city of refuge during the lifetime of the existing high priest. It was also forbidden to the high priest to follow a funeral, or rend his clothes for the dead. It does not appear by whose authority the high priests were appointed to their office before there were kings of Isr'l. After this the office seems to have been used for political rather than religious purposes. Though at first chosen for life, we find that Solomon deposed Abiathar, ( 1 Kings 2:35 ) and that Herod appointed a number of high priests, which may account for there being at least two living in Christ's time, Annas and Caiaphas. ( Luke 3:2 ) The usual are for entering upon the functions of the priesthood, according to ( 2 Chronicles 31:17 ) is considered to have been 20 years, though a priest or high priest was not actually incapacitated if he had attained to puberty. Again, according to ( Leviticus 21:17-21 ) no one that had a blemish could officiate at the altar. The theological view of the high priesthood does not fall within the scope of this work. It must suffice therefore to indicate that such a view would embrace the consideration of the office, dress, functions and ministrations of the high priest considered as typical of the priesthood of our Lord Jesus Christ, and as setting forth under shadows the truths which are openly taught under the gospel. This had been done to a great extent in the Epistle to the Hebrews. It would also embrace all the moral and spiritual teaching supposed to be intended by such symbols."], "Word": "High Places6813 Priest", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "5": {"Definitions": ["Aaron was the first who was solemnly set apart to this office ( Exodus 29:7 ;  30:23 ;  Leviticus 8:12 ).

The \"ephod\" consisted of two parts, one of which covered the back and the other the breast, which were united by the \"curious girdle.\" It was made of fine twined linen, and ornamented with gold and purple.

When the high priest, clothed with the ephod and the breastplate, inquired of the Lord, answers were given in some mysterious way by the Urim and Thummim ( 1 Samuel 14:3, 18, 19 ;  23:2, 4, 9, 11, 12 ;  28:6 ;  2 Samuel 5:23 ).", "4.

Then resuming his splendid robes, he reappeared before the people (Leviticus 16).

The office continued in the line of Eleazar, Aaron's eldest son, for two hundred and ninety-six years, when it passed to Eli, the first of the line of Ithamar, who was the fourth son of Aaron. In this line it continued to Abiathar, whom Solomon deposed, and appointed Zadok, of the family of Eleazar, in his stead ( 1 Kings 2:35 ), in which it remained till the time of the Captivity.

It was known to the Egyptians at a very early period. They had twelve hours of the day and of the night. There are two kinds of hours, viz.
