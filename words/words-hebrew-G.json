Throughout the Hebrew Scriptures two chief names are used for the one true divine Being", "ELOHIM, commonly translated  God  in our version, and JEHOVAH, translated  Lord  . Elohim is the plural of Eloah (in Arabic  Allah ); it is often used in the short form EL (a word signifying  strength  , as in EL-SHADDAI, God Almighty, the name by which God was specially known to the patriarchs. ( Genesis 17:1 ;  28:3 ;  Exodus 6:3 ) The etymology is uncertain, but it is generally agreed that the primary idea is that of  strength, power of effect  , and that it properly describes God in that character in which he is exhibited to all men in his works, as the creator, sustainer and supreme governor of the world. The plural form of Elohim has given rise to much discussion. The fanciful idea that it referred to the trinity of persons in the Godhead hardly finds now a supporter among scholars. It is either what grammarians call the  plural of majesty  , or it denotes the  fullness  of divine strength, the  sum of the powers  displayed by God. Jehovah denotes specifically the one true God, whose people the Jews were, and who made them the guardians of his truth. The name is never applied to a false god, nor to any other being except one, the ANGEL-JEHOVAH who is thereby marked as one with God, and who appears again in the New Covenant as \"God manifested in the flesh.\" Thus much is clear; but all else is beset with difficulties. At a time too early to be traced, the Jews abstained from pronouncing the name, for fear of its irreverent use. The custom is said to have been founded on a strained interpretation of ( Leviticus 24:16 ) and the phrase there used, \"THE NAME\" ( Shema ), is substituted by the rabbis for the unutterable word. In reading the Scriptures they substituted for it the word ADONAI ( Lord ), from the translation of which by  Kurios  in the LXX., followed by the Vulgate, which uses  Dominus  , we have the LORD of our version. The substitution of the word Lord is most unhappy, for it in no way represents the meaning of the sacred name. The key to the  meaning  of the name is unquestionably given in God's revelation of himself to Moses by the phrase \"I AM THAT I AM,\" ( Exodus 3:14 ;  6:3 ) We must connect the name  Jehovah  with the Hebrew substantive verb  to be  , with the inference that it expresses the essential, eternal, unchangeable  being  of Jehovah. But more, it is not the expression only, or chiefly, of an absolute truth: it is a  practical revelation  of God, in his essential, unchangeable relation to this chosen people, the basis of his  covenant."], "Word": "God", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "4": {"Definitions": ["GOD ,  noun", "1.

Throughout the Hebrew Scriptures two chief names are used for the one true divine Being", "ELOHIM, commonly translated  God  in our version, and JEHOVAH, translated  Lord  . Elohim is the plural of Eloah (in Arabic  Allah ); it is often used in the short form EL (a word signifying  strength  , as in EL-SHADDAI, God Almighty, the name by which God was specially known to the patriarchs. ( Genesis 17:1 ;  28:3 ;  Exodus 6:3 ) The etymology is uncertain, but it is generally agreed that the primary idea is that of  strength, power of effect  , and that it properly describes God in that character in which he is exhibited to all men in his works, as the creator, sustainer and supreme governor of the world. The plural form of Elohim has given rise to much discussion. The fanciful idea that it referred to the trinity of persons in the Godhead hardly finds now a supporter among scholars. It is either what grammarians call the  plural of majesty  , or it denotes the  fullness  of divine strength, the  sum of the powers  displayed by God. Jehovah denotes specifically the one true God, whose people the Jews were, and who made them the guardians of his truth. The name is never applied to a false god, nor to any other being except one, the ANGEL-JEHOVAH who is thereby marked as one with God, and who appears again in the New Covenant as \"God manifested in the flesh.\" Thus much is clear; but all else is beset with difficulties. At a time too early to be traced, the Jews abstained from pronouncing the name, for fear of its irreverent use. The custom is said to have been founded on a strained interpretation of ( Leviticus 24:16 ) and the phrase there used, \"THE NAME\" ( Shema ), is substituted by the rabbis for the unutterable word. In reading the Scriptures they substituted for it the word ADONAI ( Lord ), from the translation of which by  Kurios  in the LXX., followed by the Vulgate, which uses  Dominus  , we have the LORD of our version. The substitution of the word Lord is most unhappy, for it in no way represents the meaning of the sacred name. The key to the  meaning  of the name is unquestionably given in God's revelation of himself to Moses by the phrase \"I AM THAT I AM,\" ( Exodus 3:14 ;  6:3 ) We must connect the name  Jehovah  with the Hebrew substantive verb  to be  , with the inference that it expresses the essential, eternal, unchangeable  being  of Jehovah. But more, it is not the expression only, or chiefly, of an absolute truth: it is a  practical revelation  of God, in his essential, unchangeable relation to this chosen people, the basis of his  covenant."], "Word": "God", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "4": {"Definitions": ["GOD ,  noun", "1.

The two armies then engaged in battle, in which Abner and his host were routed and put to flight ( 2 Samuel 2:12-17 ).

The Gibeonites demanded blood for the wrong that had been done to them, and accordingly David gave up to them the two sons of Rizpah (q.v.) and the five sons of Michal, and these the Gibeonites took and hanged or crucified \"in the hill before the Lord\" ( 2 Samuel 21:9 ); and there the bodies hung for six months ( 21:10 ), and all the while Rizpah watched over the blackening corpses and \"suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.\" David afterwards removed the bones of Saul and Jonathan at Jabeshgilead ( 21:12, 13 ).", "Here, \"at the great stone,\" Amasa was put to death by Joab ( 2 Samuel 20:5-10 ).

His calling is the commencement of the second period in the history of the judges. After the victory gained by Deborah and Barak over Jabin, Israel once more sank into idolatry, and the Midianites (q.v.) and Amalekites, with other \"children of the east,\" crossed the Jordan each year for seven successive years for the purpose of plundering and desolating the land. Gideon received a direct call from God to undertake the task of delivering the land from these warlike invaders. He was of the family of Abiezer ( Joshua 17:2 ;  1 Chronicles 7:18 ), and of the little township of Ophrah ( Judges 6:11 ). First, with ten of his servants, he overthrew the altars of Baal and cut down the asherah which was upon it, and then blew the trumpet of alarm, and the people flocked to his standard on the crest of Mount Gilboa to the number of twenty-two thousand men. These were, however, reduced to only three hundred. These, strangely armed with torches and pitchers and trumpets, rushed in from three different points on the camp of Midian at midnight, in the valley to the north of Moreh, with the terrible war-cry, \"For the Lord and for Gideon\" ( Judges 7:18 , R.V.). Terror-stricken, the Midianites were put into dire confusion, and in the darkness slew one another, so that only fifteen thousand out of the great army of one hundred and twenty thousand escaped alive. The memory of this great deliverance impressed itself deeply on the mind of the nation ( 1 Samuel 12:11 ;  Psalms 83:11 ;  Isaiah 9:4 ;  10:26 ;  Hebrews 11:32 ). The land had now rest for forty years. Gideon died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of his fathers. Soon after his death a change came over the people. They again forgot Jehovah, and turned to the worship of Baalim, \"neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal\" ( Judges 8:35 ). Gideon left behind him seventy sons, a feeble, sadly degenerated race, with one exception, that of Abimelech, who seems to have had much of the courage and energy of his father, yet of restless and unscrupulous ambition. He gathered around him a band who slaughtered all Gideon's sons, except Jotham, upon one stone.

He was the fifth recorded judge of Isr'l, and for many reasons the greatest of them all. When we first hear of him he was grown up and had sons, ( Judges 6:11 ;  8:20 ) and from the apostrophe of the angel, ch. ( Judges 6:12 ) we may conclude that he had already distinguished himself in war against the roving bands of nomadic robbers who had oppressed Isr'l for seven years. When the angel appeared, Gideon was threshing wheat with a flail in the wine-press, to conceal it from the predatory tyrants. His call to be a deliverer, and his destruction of Baal's altar, are related in Judges 6. After this begins the second act of Gideon's life. Clothed by the Spirit of God, ( Judges 6:34 ) comp.  1 Chronicles 12:18 ;  Luke 24:49  He blew a trumpet, and was joined by Zebulun, Naphtali and even the reluctant Asher. Strengthened by a double sign from God, he reduced his army of 32,000 by the usual proclamation. ( 20:8 ) comp. 1 Macc. 3.56. By a second test at \"the spring of trembling the further reduced the number of his followers to 300. ( Judges 7:5 ) seq. The midnight attack upon the Midianites, their panic, and the rout and slaughter that followed are told in ( Judges 7:1 ) ... The memory of this splendid deliverance took deep root in the national traditions. ( 1 Samuel 12:11 ;  Psalms 83:11 ;  Isaiah 9:4 ;  10:26 ;  Hebrews 11:32 ) After this there was a peace of forty years, and we see Gideon in peaceful possession of his well-earned honors, and surrounded by the dignity of a numerous household. ( Judges 8:29-31 ) It is not improbable that, like Saul, he owed a part of his popularity to his princely appearance. ( Judges 8:18 ) In this third stage of his life occur alike his most noble and his most questionable acts viz., the refusal of the monarchy on theocratic grounds, and the irregular consecration of a jewelled ephod formed out of the rich spoils of Midian, which proved to the Isr'lites a temptation to idolatry although it was doubtless intended for use in the worship of Jehovah."], "Word": "Gideon", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "5": {"Definitions": ["same as Gideon"], "Word": "Gideoni", "Dictionary": "Hitchcock's Names Dictionary"}, "6": {"Definitions": ["Father of Abidan.

This name, which in the Roman age was applied to a large province, seems to have been originally confined to a little \"circuit\" of country round Kedesh-Naphtali, in which were situated the twenty towns given by Solomon to Hiram king of Tyre as payment for his work in conveying timber from Lebanon to Jerusalem. ( Joshua 20:7 ;  1 Kings 9:11 ) In the time of our Lord all Palestine was divided into three provinces, Judea, Samaria and Galilee. ( Luke 17:11 ;  Acts 9:31 ) Joseph. B.J. iii. 3. The latter included the whole northern section of the country, including the ancient territories of Issachar, Zebulun, Asher and Naphtali. On the west it was bounded by the territory of Ptolemais, which probably included the whole plain of Akka to the foot of Carmel. The southern border ran along the base of Carmel and of the hills of Samaria to Mount Gilboa, and then descended the valley of Jezreel by Scythopolis to the Jordan. The river Jordan, the Sea of Galilee, and the upper Jordan to the fountain at Dan, formed the eastern border; and the northern ran from Dan westward across the mountain ridge till it touched the territory of the Phoenicians. Galilee was divided into two sections, \"Lower\" and \"Upper.\" Lower Galilee included the great plain of Esdr'lon with its offshoots, which ran down to the Jordan and the Lake of Tiberias, and the whole of the hill country adjoining it on the north to the foot of the mountain range. It was thus one of the richest and most beautiful sections of Pales-tine. Upper Galilee embraced the whole mountain range lying between the upper Jordan and Phoenicia. To this region the name \"Galilee of the Gentiles\" is given in the Old and New Testaments. ( Isaiah 9:1 ;  Matthew 4:16 ) Galilee was the scene of the greater part of our Lord's private life and public acts. It is a remarkable fact that the first three Gospels are chiefly taken up with our Lord's ministrations in this province, while the Gospel of John dwells more upon those in Judea. ( Galilee in the time of Christ  .", "From Rev. Selah Merrill's late book (1881) with this title, we glean the following facts:  Size  .", "It is estimated that of the 1000 square miles in Palestine west of the Jordan, nearly one-third, almost 2000 square miles, belongs to Galilee.  Population", "The population is between 2,000,000 and 3,000,000. Dr. Merrill argues for the general correctness of Josephus' estimates, who says there were 204 cities and villages in Galilee, the smallest of which numbered 15,000 inhabitants.  Character of the country  . Galilee was a region of great natural fertility. Such is the fertility of the soil that it rejects no plant, for the air is so genial that it suits every variety. The walnut, which delights above other trees in a wintry climate, grows here luxuriantly together with the palm tree, which is flourished by heat. It not only possesses the extraordinary virtue of nourishing fruits of opposite climes, but also maintains a continual supply of them. Here were found all the productions which made Italy rich and beautiful. Forests covered its mountains and hills, while its uplands, gentle slopes and broader valleys were rich in pasture, meadows, cultivated fields, vineyards, olive groves and fruit trees of every kind.  Character of the Galileans  .", "They were thoroughly a Jewish people. With few exceptions they were wealthy and in general an influential class. If one should say the Jews were bigoted in religion, he should remember at the same time that in regard to social, commercial and political relations none were more cosmopolitan in either sentiment or practice than they. The Galileans had many manufactures, fisheries, some commerce, but were chiefly an agricultural people. They were eminent for patriotism and courage, as were their ancestors, with great respect for law and order.", "ED.)"], "Word": "Galilee", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "5": {"Definitions": ["( Matthew 4:18 ;  15:29 ), is mentioned in the Bible under three other names.", "1.

Its depth is from 80 to 160 feet. The Jordan enters it 10 1/2 miles below the southern extremity of the Huleh Lake, or about 26 1/2 miles from its source. In this distance of 26 1/2 miles there is a fall in the river of 1,682 feet, or of more than 60 feet to the mile. It is 27 miles east of the Mediterranean, and about 60 miles north-east of Jerusalem. It is of an oval shape, and abounds in fish.", "Its present appearance is thus described- \"The utter loneliness and absolute stillness of the scene are exceedingly impressive. It seems as if all nature had gone to rest, languishing under the scorching heat. How different it was in the days of our Lord! Then all was life and bustle along the shores; the cities and villages that thickly studded them resounded with the hum of a busy population; while from hill-side and corn-field came the cheerful cry of shepherd and ploughman. The lake, too, was dotted with dark fishing-boats and spangled with white sails. Now a mournful, solitary silence reigns over sea and shore. The cities are in ruins!\"", "This sea is chiefly of interest as associated with the public ministry of our Lord. Capernaum, \"his own city\" ( Matthew 9:1 ), stood on its shores. From among the fishermen who plied their calling on its waters he chose Peter and his brother Andrew, and James and John, to be disciples, and sent them forth to be \"fishers of men\" ( Matthew 4:18, 22 ;  Mark 1:16-20 ;  Luke 5:1-11 ). He stilled its tempest, saying to the storm that swept over it, \"Peace, be still\" ( Matthew 8:23-27 ;  Mark 7:31-35 ); and here also he showed himself after his resurrection to his disciples ( John 21 ).", "\"The Sea of Galilee is indeed the cradle of the gospel. The subterranean fires of nature prepared a lake basin, through which a river afterwards ran, keeping its waters always fresh. In this basin a vast quantity of shell-fish swarmed, and multiplied to such an extent that they formed the food of an extraordinary profusion of fish. The great variety and abundance of the fish in the lake attracted to its shores a larger and more varied population than existed elsewhere in Palestine, whereby this secluded district was brought into contact with all parts of the world. And this large and varied population, with access to all nations and countries, attracted the Lord Jesus, and induced him to make this spot the centre of his public ministry.\""], "Word": "Galilee, Sea of", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "6": {"Definitions": ["So called from the province of Galilee, which bordered on the western side.

The Sea of Galilee is of an oval long and six broad. It is 60 miles northeast of Jerusalem and 27 east of the Mediterranean Sea. The river Jordan enters it at its northern end and passes out at its southern end. In fact the bed of the lake is just a lower section of the Great Jordan valley. Its more remarkable feature is its deep depression, being no less than 700 feet below the level of the ocean. The scenery is bleak and monotonous, being surrounded by a high and almost unbroken wall of hills, on account of which it is exposed to frequent sudden and violent storms. The great depression makes the climate of the shores almost tropical. This is very sensibly felt by the traveller in going down from the plains of Galilee. In summer the heat is intense, and even in early spring the air has something of an Egyptian balminess. The water of the lake is sweet, cool and transparent; and as the beach is everywhere pebbly is has a beautiful sparkling look. It abounds in fish now as in ancient times.

Throughout the Hebrew Scriptures two chief names are used for the one true divine Being", "ELOHIM, commonly translated  God  in our version, and JEHOVAH, translated  Lord  . Elohim is the plural of Eloah (in Arabic  Allah ); it is often used in the short form EL (a word signifying  strength  , as in EL-SHADDAI, God Almighty, the name by which God was specially known to the patriarchs. ( Genesis 17:1 ;  28:3 ;  Exodus 6:3 ) The etymology is uncertain, but it is generally agreed that the primary idea is that of  strength, power of effect  , and that it properly describes God in that character in which he is exhibited to all men in his works, as the creator, sustainer and supreme governor of the world. The plural form of Elohim has given rise to much discussion. The fanciful idea that it referred to the trinity of persons in the Godhead hardly finds now a supporter among scholars. It is either what grammarians call the  plural of majesty  , or it denotes the  fullness  of divine strength, the  sum of the powers  displayed by God. Jehovah denotes specifically the one true God, whose people the Jews were, and who made them the guardians of his truth. The name is never applied to a false god, nor to any other being except one, the ANGEL-JEHOVAH who is thereby marked as one with God, and who appears again in the New Covenant as \"God manifested in the flesh.\" Thus much is clear; but all else is beset with difficulties. At a time too early to be traced, the Jews abstained from pronouncing the name, for fear of its irreverent use. The custom is said to have been founded on a strained interpretation of ( Leviticus 24:16 ) and the phrase there used, \"THE NAME\" ( Shema ), is substituted by the rabbis for the unutterable word. In reading the Scriptures they substituted for it the word ADONAI ( Lord ), from the translation of which by  Kurios  in the LXX., followed by the Vulgate, which uses  Dominus  , we have the LORD of our version. The substitution of the word Lord is most unhappy, for it in no way represents the meaning of the sacred name. The key to the  meaning  of the name is unquestionably given in God's revelation of himself to Moses by the phrase \"I AM THAT I AM,\" ( Exodus 3:14 ;  6:3 ) We must connect the name  Jehovah  with the Hebrew substantive verb  to be  , with the inference that it expresses the essential, eternal, unchangeable  being  of Jehovah. But more, it is not the expression only, or chiefly, of an absolute truth: it is a  practical revelation  of God, in his essential, unchangeable relation to this chosen people, the basis of his  covenant."], "Word": "God", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "4": {"Definitions": ["GOD ,  noun", "1.

The promise of the land of Canaan to the seed of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob successively, and the separation of the Isr'lites from the Gentile world; the expectation of Messiah as to spring from the tribe of Judah; the exclusively hereditary priesthood of Aaron with its dignity and emoluments; the long succession of kings in the line of David; and the whole division and occupations of the land upon genealogical principles by the tribes, occupation of the land upon genealogical principles by the tribes, families and houses of fathers, gave a deeper importance to the science of genealogy among the Jews than perhaps any other nation. When Zerubbabel brought back the captivity from Babylon, one of his first cares seems to have been to take a census of those that returned, and to settle them according to their genealogies. Passing on to the time of the birth of Christ, we have a striking incidental proof of the continuance of the Jewish genealogical economy in the fact that when Augustus ordered the census of the empire to be taken, the Jews in the province of Syria immediately went each one to his own city. The Jewish genealogical records continued to be kept till near the destruction of Jerusalem. But there can be little doubt that the registers of the Jewish tribes and families perished at the destruction of Jerusalem, and not before. It remains to be said that just notions of the nature of the Jewish genealogical records are of great importance with a view to the right interpretation of Scripture. Let it only be remembered that these records have respect to political and territorial divisions as much as to strictly genealogical descent, and it will at once be seen how erroneous a conclusion it may be that all who are called \"sons\" of such or such a patriarch or chief father must necessarily be his very children. Of any one family or house became extinct, some other would succeed to its place, called after its own chief father. Hence of course a census of any tribe drawn up at a later period would exhibit different divisions from one drawn up at an earlier. The same principle must be borne in mind in interpreting any particular genealogy Again, when a pedigree was abbreviated, it would naturally specify such generations as would indicates from what chief houses the person descended. Females are named in genealogies when there is anything remarkable about them, or when any right or property is transmitted through them.

The promise of the land of Canaan to the seed of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob successively, and the separation of the Isr'lites from the Gentile world; the expectation of Messiah as to spring from the tribe of Judah; the exclusively hereditary priesthood of Aaron with its dignity and emoluments; the long succession of kings in the line of David; and the whole division and occupations of the land upon genealogical principles by the tribes, occupation of the land upon genealogical principles by the tribes, families and houses of fathers, gave a deeper importance to the science of genealogy among the Jews than perhaps any other nation. When Zerubbabel brought back the captivity from Babylon, one of his first cares seems to have been to take a census of those that returned, and to settle them according to their genealogies. Passing on to the time of the birth of Christ, we have a striking incidental proof of the continuance of the Jewish genealogical economy in the fact that when Augustus ordered the census of the empire to be taken, the Jews in the province of Syria immediately went each one to his own city. The Jewish genealogical records continued to be kept till near the destruction of Jerusalem. But there can be little doubt that the registers of the Jewish tribes and families perished at the destruction of Jerusalem, and not before. It remains to be said that just notions of the nature of the Jewish genealogical records are of great importance with a view to the right interpretation of Scripture. Let it only be remembered that these records have respect to political and territorial divisions as much as to strictly genealogical descent, and it will at once be seen how erroneous a conclusion it may be that all who are called \"sons\" of such or such a patriarch or chief father must necessarily be his very children. Of any one family or house became extinct, some other would succeed to its place, called after its own chief father. Hence of course a census of any tribe drawn up at a later period would exhibit different divisions from one drawn up at an earlier. The same principle must be borne in mind in interpreting any particular genealogy Again, when a pedigree was abbreviated, it would naturally specify such generations as would indicates from what chief houses the person descended. Females are named in genealogies when there is anything remarkable about them, or when any right or property is transmitted through them.

Its earliest inhabitants were the Avims, who were conquered and displaced by the Caphtorims ( Deuteronomy 2:23 ;  Joshua 13:2, 3 ), a Philistine tribe. In the division of the land it fell to the lot of Judah ( Joshua 15:47 ;  Judges 1:18 ). It was the southernmost of the five great Philistine cities which gave each a golden emerod as a trespass-offering unto the Lord ( 1 Samuel 6:17 ). Its gates were carried away by Samson ( Judges 16:1-3) . Here he was afterwards a prisoner, and \"did grind in the prison house.\" Here he also pulled down the temple of Dagon, and slew \"all the lords of the Philistines,\" himself also perishing in the ruin ( Judges 16:21-30 ). The prophets denounce the judgments of God against it ( Jeremiah 25:20 ;  47:5 ;  Amos 1:6, 7 ;  Zephaniah 2:4 ). It is referred to in  Acts 8:26 .

It is remarkable for its continuous existence and importance from the very earliest times. The secret of this unbroken history is to be found in the situation of Gaza. It is the last town in the southwest of Palestine, on the frontier towards Egypt. The same peculiarity of situation has made Gaza important in a military sense. Its name means \"the strong;\" and this was well elucidated in its siege by Alexander the Great, which lasted five months. In the conquest of Joshua the territory of Gaza is mentioned as one which he was not able to subdue. ( Joshua 10:41 ;  11:22 ;  13:3 ) It was assigned to the tribe of Judah, ( Joshua 15:47 ) and that tribe did obtain possession of it, ( Judges 1:18 ) but did not hold it long, ( Judges 3:3 ;  13:1 ) and apparently it continued through the time of Samuel, Saul and David to be a Philistine city.  1 Samuel 6:17 ;  14:52 ;  31:1 ;  2 Samuel 21:15  Solomon became master of \"Azzah,\" ( 1 Kings 4:24 ) but in after times the same trouble with the Philistines recurred. ( 2 Chronicles 21:16 ;  26:6 ;  28:18 ) The passage where Gaza is mentioned in the New Testament ( Acts 8:26 ) is full of interest. It is the account of the baptism of the Ethiopian eunuch on his return from Jerusalem to Egypt. Gaza is the modern  Ghuzzeh  , a Mohammedan town of about 16,000 inhabitants, situated partly on an oblong hill of moderate height and partly on the lower ground. The climate of the place is almost tropical, but it has deep wells of excellent water. There are a few palm trees in the town, and its fruit orchards are very productive; but the chief feature of the neighborhood is the wide-spread olive grove to the north and northeast"], "Word": "Gaza", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "5": {"Definitions": ["a treasurer"], "Word": "Gazabar", "Dictionary": "Hitchcock's Names Dictionary"}, "6": {"Definitions": ["Inhabitants of Gaza Joshua 13:3", "Called Gazites Judges 16:2"], "Word": "Gazathites", "Dictionary": "Naves Topical Index"}, "7": {"Definitions": ["( Joshua 13:3 ) the inhabitants of Gaza."], "Word": "Gazathites, the", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}}}
