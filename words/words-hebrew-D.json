The Arabs call it Bahr Lut, i.e., the Sea of Lot. It lies about 16 miles in a straight line to the east of Jerusalem. Its surface is 1,292 feet below the surface of the Mediterranean Sea. It covers an area of about 300 square miles. Its depth varies from 1,310 to 11 feet. From various phenomena that have been observed, its bottom appears to be still subsiding. It is about 53 miles long, and of an average breadth of 10 miles. It has no outlet, the great heat of that region causing such rapid evaporation that its average depth, notwithstanding the rivers that run into it (see  JORDAN ), is maintained with little variation. The Jordan alone discharges into it no less than six million tons of water every twenty-four hours.", "The waters of the Dead Sea contain 24.6 per cent. of mineral salts, about seven times as much as in ordinary sea-water; thus they are unusually buoyant. Chloride of magnesium is most abundant; next to that chloride of sodium (common salt). But terraces of alluvial deposits in the deep valley of the Jordan show that formerly one great lake extended from the Waters of Merom to the foot of the watershed in the Arabah. The waters were then about 1,400 feet above the present level of the Dead Sea, or slightly above that of the Mediterranean, and at that time were much less salt.", "Nothing living can exist in this sea. \"The fish carried down by the Jordan at once die, nor can even mussels or corals live in it; but it is a fable that no bird can fly over it, or that there are no living creatures on its banks. Dr. Tristram found on the shores three kinds of kingfishers, gulls, ducks, and grebes, which he says live on the fish which enter the sea in shoals, and presently die. He collected one hundred and eighteen species of birds, some new to science, on the shores, or swimming or flying over the waters. The cane-brakes which fringe it at some parts are the homes of about forty species of mammalia, several of them animals unknown in England; and innumerable tropical or semi-tropical plants perfume the atmosphere wherever fresh water can reach. The climate is perfect and most delicious, and indeed there is perhaps no place in the world where a sanatorium could be established with so much prospect of benefit as at Ain Jidi (Engedi).\", Geikie's Hours, etc."], "Word": "Dead Sea", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "4": {"Definitions": ["Lies southeast of Jerusalem.", "Called Salt Sea Genesis 14:3 ;  Numbers 34:12", "Called Sea of the Plain Deuteronomy 3:17 ;  Deuteronomy 4:49 ;  Joshua 3:16", "Called East Sea Joel 2:20", "Called Former Sea Zech 14:8", "Prophecy concerning Ezekiel 47:7-10 ;  Ezekiel 47:18"], "Word": "Dead Sea", "Dictionary": "Naves Topical Index"}, "5": {"Definitions": ["This name nowhere occurs in the Bible, and appears not to have existed until the second century after Christ.

It was a grazing tract, where the flocks and herds of the Israelites found pasturage during the whole of their journey to the Promised Land.", "The same Hebrew word is used also to denote the wilderness of Arabia, which in winter and early spring supplies good pasturage to the flocks of the nomad tribes than roam over it ( 1 Kings 9:18 ).", "The wilderness of Judah is the mountainous region along the western shore of the Dead Sea, where David fed his father's flocks ( 1 Samuel 17:28 ;  26:2 ).

While midbar denotes properly a pastoral region, arabah denotes a wilderness. It is also translated \"plains;\" as \"the plains of Jericho\" ( Joshua 5:10 ;  2 Kings 25:5 ), \"the plains of Moab\" ( Numbers 22:1 ;  Deuteronomy 34:1, 8 ), \"the plains of the wilderness\" ( 2 Samuel 17:16 ).", "3.  In the Revised Version of  Numbers 21:20  the Hebrew word jeshimon is properly rendered \"desert,\" meaning the waste tracts on both shores of the Dead Sea. This word is also rendered \"desert\" in  Psalms 78:40 ;  106:14 ;  Isaiah 43:19, 20 . It denotes a greater extent of uncultivated country than the other words so rendered. It is especially applied to the desert of the peninsula of Arabia ( Numbers 21:20 ;  23:28 ), the most terrible of all the deserts with which the Israelites were acquainted. It is called \"the desert\" in  Exodus 23:31 ;  Deuteronomy 11:24 . (See  JESHIMON .)", "4.  A dry place; hence a desolation ( Psalms 9:6 ), desolate ( Leviticus 26:34 ); the rendering of the Hebrew word horbah'. It is rendered \"desert\" only in  Psalms 102:6 ,  Isaiah 48:21 , and  Ezekiel 13:4 , where it means the wilderness of Sinai.", "5.  This word is the symbol of the Jewish church when they had forsaken God ( Isaiah 40:3 ). Nations destitute of the knowledge of God are called a \"wilderness\" ( 32:15 , midbar). It is a symbol of temptation, solitude, and persecution ( Isaiah 27:10 , midbar_;  33:9 , _arabah)."], "Word": "Desert", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "2": {"Definitions": ["An arid region bearing only a sparse vegetation Leviticus 16:22 ;  Deuteronomy 8:15 ;  Jeremiah 2:2 ;  Jeremiah 2:6 ;  Jeremiah 17:6", "Figurative Isaiah 35:1"], "Word": "Desert", "Dictionary": "Naves Topical Index"}, "3": {"Definitions": ["Not a stretch of sand, an utterly barren waste, but a wild, uninhabited region.

His father seems to have been a man in humble life. His mother's name is not recorded. Some think she was the Nahash of  2 Samuel 17:25 . As to his personal appearance, we only know that he was red-haired, with beautiful eyes and a fair face ( 1 Samuel 16:1-2 ;  1 Samuel 17:42 ).", "His early occupation was that of tending his father's sheep on the uplands of Judah. From what we know of his after history, doubtless he frequently beguiled his time, when thus engaged, with his shepherd's flute, while he drank in the many lessons taught him by the varied scenes spread around him. His first recorded exploits were his encounters with the wild beasts of the field. He mentions that with his own unaided hand he slew a lion and also a bear, when they came out against his flock, beating them to death in open conflict with his club ( 1 Samuel 17:34 ,  35 ).", "While David, in the freshness of ruddy youth, was thus engaged with his flocks, Samuel paid an unexpected visit to Bethlehem, having been guided thither by divine direction ( 1 Samuel 16:1-13 ). There he offered up sacrifice, and called the elders of Israel and Jesse's family to the sacrificial meal. Among all who appeared before him he failed to discover the one he sought. David was sent for, and the prophet immediately recognized him as the chosen of God, chosen to succeed Saul, who was now departing from the ways of God, on the throne of the kingdom. He accordingly, in anticipation, poured on his head the anointing oil. David went back again to his shepherd life, but \"the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward,\" and \"the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul\" ( 1 Samuel 16:13 ,  14 ).", "Not long after this David was sent for to soothe with his harp the troubled spirit of Saul, who suffered from a strange melancholy dejection. He played before the king so skilfully that Saul was greatly cheered, and began to entertain great affection for the young shepherd. After this he went home to Bethlehem. But he soon again came into prominence. The armies of the Philistines and of Israel were in battle array in the valley of Elah, some 16 miles south-west of Bethlehem; and David was sent by his father with provisions for his three brothers, who were then fighting on the side of the king. On his arrival in the camp of Israel, David (now about twenty years of age) was made aware of the state of matters when the champion of the Philistines, Goliath of Gath, came forth to defy Israel. David took his sling, and with a well-trained aim threw a stone \"out of the brook,\" which struck the giant's forehead, so that he fell senseless to the ground. David then ran and slew him, and cut off his head with his own sword (1 Samuel 17). The result was a great victory to the Israelites, who pursued the Philistines to the gates of Gath and Ekron.", "David's popularity consequent on this heroic exploit awakened Saul's jealousy ( 1 Samuel 18:6-16 ), which he showed in various ways. He conceived a bitter hatred toward him, and by various stratagems sought his death (1 Samuel 18-30). The deep-laid plots of the enraged king, who could not fail to observe that David \"prospered exceedingly,\" all proved futile, and only endeared the young hero the more to the people, and very specially to Jonathan, Saul's son, between whom and David a life-long warm friendship was formed.", "A fugitive. To escape from the vengeance of Saul, David fled to Ramah ( 1 Samuel 19:12-18 ) to Samuel, who received him, and he dwelt among the sons of the prophets, who were there under Samuel's training. It is supposed by some that the sixth, seventh, and eleventh Psalms were composed by him at this time. This place was only 3 miles from the residence of Saul, who soon discovered whither the fugitive had gone, and tried ineffectually to bring him back. Jonathan made a fruitless effort to bring his father to a better state of mind toward David (1 Samuel 20), who, being made aware of the fact, saw no hope of safety but in flight to a distance. We accordingly find him first at Nob ( 21:1-9 ) and then at Gath, the chief city of the Philistines. The king of the Philistines would not admit him into his service, as he expected that he would, and David accordingly now betook himself to the stronghold of Adullam ( 22:1-4 ;  1 Chronicles 12:8-18 ). Here in a short time 400 men gathered around him and acknowledged him as their leader. It was at this time that David, amid the harassment and perils of his position, cried, \"Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem;\" when three of his heroes broke through the lines of the Philistines and brought him the water for which he longed ( 2 Samuel 23:13-17 ), but which he would not drink.", "In his rage at the failure of all his efforts to seize David, Saul gave orders for the massacre of the entire priestly family at Nob, \"persons who wore a linen ephod\", to the number of eighty-five persons, who were put to death by Doeg the Edomite. The sad tidings of the massacre were brought to David by Abiathar, a son of Ahimelech, the only one who escaped. Comp. Psalms 52.", "Hearing that Keilah, a town on the western frontier, was harassed by the Philistines, David with his men relieved it ( 1 Samuel 23:1-14 ); and then, for fear of Saul, he fled to the strongholds in the \"hill country\" of Judah. Comp. Psalms 31. While encamped there, in the forest in the district of Ziph, he was visited by Jonathan, who spoke to him words of encouragement ( 23:16-18 ). The two now parted never to meet again. Saul continued his pursuit of David, who narrowly escaped from him at this time, and fled to the crags and ravines of Engedi, on the western shore of the Dead Sea ( 1 Samuel 23:29 ). Here Saul, who still pursued him with his army, narrowly escaped, through the generous forbearance of David, and was greatly affected by what David had done for him. He returned home from pursuing him, and David betook himself to Maon, where, with his 600 men, he maintained himself by contributions gathered from the district. Here occurred the incident connected with Nabal and his wife Abigail (1 Samuel 25), whom David married after Nabal's death.", "Saul again went forth (1 Samuel 26) in pursuit of David, who had hid himself \"in the hill Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon,\" in the wilderness of Ziph, and was a second time spared through his forbearance. He returned home, professing shame and penitence for the way in which he had treated David, and predicting his elevation to the throne.", "Fighting against Israel. Harassed by the necessity of moving from place to place through fear of Saul, David once more sought refuge among the Philistines (1 Samuel 27). He was welcomed by the king, who assigned him Ziklag as his residence. Here David lived among his followers for some time as an independent chief engaged in frequent war with the Amalekites and other tribes on the south of Judah.", "Achish summoned David with his men to join his army against Saul; but the lords of the Philistines were suspicious of David's loyalty, and therefore he was sent back to Ziklag, which he found to his dismay may had been pillaged and burnt during his brief absence. David pursued after the raiders, the Amalekites, and completely routed them. On his return to Ziklag tidings reached him of Saul's death (2 Samuel 1). An Amalekite brought Saul's crown and bracelet and laid them at his feet. David and his men rent their clothes and mourned for Saul, who had been defeated in battle near Mount Gilboa. David composed a beautiful elegy, the most beautiful of all extant Hebrew odes, a \"lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son\" ( 2 Samuel 1:18-27 ). It bore the title of \"The Bow,\" and was to be taught to the children, that the memory of Saul and Jonathan might be preserved among them. \"Behold, it is written in the book of Jasher\" (q.v.).", "David king over Judah. David and his men now set out for Hebron under divine direction ( 2 Samuel 2:1-4) . There they were cordially welcomed, and he was at once anointed as king. He was now about thirty years of age.", "But his title to the throne was not undisputed. Abner took Ish-bosheth, Saul's only remaining son, over the Jordan to Mahanaim, and there crowned him as king. Then began a civil war in Israel. The first encounter between the two opposing armies, led on the one side by Abner, and on the other by Joab, took place at the pool of Gibeon. It resulted in the defeat of Abner. Other encounters, however, between Israel and Judah followed ( 2 Samuel 3:1, 5 ), but still success was on the side of David. For the space of seven and a half years David reigned in Hebron. Abner now sided with David, and sought to promote his advancement; but was treacherously put to death by Joab in revenge for his having slain his brother Asahel at Gibeon ( 3:22-39 ). This was greatly to David's regret. He mourned for the death of Abner. Shortly after this Ish-bosheth was also treacherously put to death by two Canaanites of Beeroth; and there being now no rival, David was anointed king over all Israel ( 4:1-12 ).", "David king over all Israel ( 2 Samuel 5:1-5;   1 Chronicles 11:1-3) . The elders of Israel now repaired to Hebron and offered allegiance to David in name of all the people, among whom the greatest enthusiasm prevailed. He was anointed king over all Israel, and sought out a new seat of government, more suitable than Hebron, as the capital of his empire. At this time there was a Jebusite fortress, \"the stronghold\", on the hill of Zion, called also Jebus. This David took from the Jebusites, and made it Israel's capital, and established here his residence, and afterwards built for himself a palace by the aid of Tyrian tradesmen. The Philistines, who had for some time observed a kind of truce, now made war against David; but were defeated in battle at a place afterwards called, in remembrance of the victory, Baal-perazim. Again they invaded the land, and were a second time routed by him. He thus delivered Israel from their enemies.", "David now resolved to bring up the ark of the covenant to his new capital (2 Samuel 6). It was in the house of Abinadab at Kirjath-jearim, about 7 miles from Jerusalem, where it had been for many years, from the time when the Philistines had sent it home (1 Samuel 6; 7). In consequence of the death of Uzzah (for it was a divine ordinance that only the Levites should handle the ark, Numbers 4), who had put forth his hand to steady the ark when the cart in which it was being conveyed shook by reason of the roughness of the road, David stayed the procession, and conveyed the ark into the house of Obed-edom, a Philistine from Gath. After three months David brought the ark from the house of Obed-edom up to Jerusalem. Comp. Psalms 24. Here it was placed in a new tent or tabernacle which David erected for the purpose. About seventy years had passed since it had stood in the tabernacle at Shiloh. The old tabernacle was now at Gibeah, at which Zadok ministered. David now (1 Chronicles 16) carefully set in order all the ritual of divine worship at Jerusalem, along with Abiathar the high priest. A new religious era began. The service of praise was for the first time introduced into public worship. Zion became henceforth \"God's holy hill.\"", "David's wars. David now entered on a series of conquests which greatly extended and strengthened his kingdom (2 Samuel 8). In a few years the whole territory from the Euphrates to the river of Egypt, and from Gaza on the west to Thapsacus on the east, was under his sway ( 2 Samuel 8:3-13 ; 10).", "David's fall. He had now reached the height of his glory. He ruled over a vast empire, and his capital was enriched with the spoils of many lands. But in the midst of all this success he fell, and his character became stained with the sin of adultery ( 2 Samuel 11:2-27 ). It has been noted as characteristic of the Bible that while his military triumphs are recorded in a few verses, the sad story of his fall is given in detail, a story full of warning, and therefore recorded. This crime, in the attempt to conceal it, led to anoter. He was guilty of murder. Uriah, whom he had foully wronged, an officer of the Gibborim, the corps of heros ( 23:39 ), was, by his order, \"set in the front of the hottest battle\" at the siege of Rabbah, in order that he might be put to death. Nathan the prophet ( 2 Samuel 7:1-17 ;  12:1-23 ) was sent by God to bring home his crimes to the conscience of the guilty monarch. He became a true penitent. He bitterly bewailed his sins before God. The thirty-second and fifty-first Psalms reveal the deep struggles of his soul, and his spiritual recovery.", "Bathsheba became his wife after Uriah's death. Her first-born son died, according to the word of the prophet. She gave birth to a second son, whom David called Solomon, and who ultimately succeeded him on the throne ( 2 Samuel 12:24, 25 ).", "Peace. After the successful termination of all his wars, David formed the idea of building a temple for the ark of God. This he was not permitted to carry into execution, because he had been a man of war. God, however, sent Nathan to him with a gracious message ( 2 Samuel 7:1-16 ). On receiving it he went into the sanctuary, the tent where the ark was, and sat before the Lord, and poured out his heart in words of devout thanksgiving (18-29). The building of the temple was reserved for his son Solomon, who would be a man of peace ( 1 Chronicles 22:9 ;  28:3 ).", "A cloudy evening. Hitherto David's carrer had been one of great prosperity and success. Now cloudy and dark days came. His eldest son Amnon, whose mother was Ahinoam of Jezreel, was guilty of a great and shameful crime (2 Samuel 13). This was the beginning of the disasters of his later years. After two years Absalom terribly avenged the crime against Tamar, and put Amnon to death. This brought sore trouble to David's heart. Absalom, afraid of the consequences of his guilt, fled to Geshur beyond Jordan, where he remained for three years, when he was brought back through the intrigue of Joab (2 Samuel 14).", "After this there fell upon the land the calamity of three years' famine ( 2 Samuel 21:1-14 ). This was soon after followed by a pestilence, brought upon the land as a punishment for David's sinful pride in numbering the people (2 Samuel 24), in which no fewer than 70,000 perished in the space of three days.", "Rebellion of Absalom. The personal respect for David was sadly lowered by the incident of Bathsheba. There was a strong popular sentiment against the taking of the census, and the outburst of the plague in connection with it deepened the feeling of jealously that had begun to manifest itself among some of the tribes against David. Absalom, taking full advantage of this state of things, gradually gained over the people, and at length openly rebelled against his father, and usurped the throne. Ahithophel was Absalom's chief counsellor. The revolt began in Hebron, the capital of Judah. Absalom was there proclaimed king. David was now in imminent danger, and he left Jerusalem ( 2 Samuel 15:13-20 ), and once more became a fugitive. It was a momentous day in Israel. The incidents of it are recorded with a fulness of detail greater than of any other day in Old Testament history. David fled with his followers to Mahanarm, on the east of Jordan. An unnatural civil war broke out. After a few weeks the rival armies were mustered and organized. They met in hostile array at the wood of Ephraim ( 2 Samuel 18:1-8) . Absalom's army was defeated, and himself put to death by the hand of Joab (9-18). The tidings of the death of his rebellious son filled the heart of David with the most poignant grief. He \"went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept\" (33), giving utterance to the heart-broken cry, \"Would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!\" Peace was now restored, and David returned to Jerusalem and resumed the direction of affairs. An unhappy dispute arose between the men of Judah and the men of Israel ( 19:41-43 ). Sheba, a Benjamite, headed a revolt of the men of Israel. He was pursued to Abelbeth-maachah, and was there put to death, and so the revolt came to an end.", "The end. After the suppression of the rebellion of Absalom and that of Sheba, ten comparatively peaceful years of David's life passed away. During those years he seems to have been principally engaged in accumulating treasures of every kind for the great temple at Jerusalem, which it was reserved to his successor to build (1 Chronicles 22; 28; 29), a house which was to be \"exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries\" ( 22:5 ). The exciting and laborious life he had spent, and the dangers and trials through which he had passed, had left him an enfeebled man, prematurely old. It became apparent that his life was now drawing to its close. A new palace conspiracy broke out as to who should be his successor. Joab favoured Adonijah. The chiefs of his party met at the \"Fuller's spring,\" in the valley of Kidron, to proclaim him king; but Nathan hastened on a decision on the part of David in favour of Solomon, and so the aim of Adonijah's party failed. Solomon was brought to Jerusalem, and was anointed king and seated on his father's throne ( 1 Kings 1:11-53 ). David's last words are a grand utterance, revealing his unfailing faith in God, and his joyful confidence in his gracious covenant promises ( 2 Samuel 23:1-7) .", "After a reign of forty years and six months ( 2 Samuel 5:5 ;  1 Chronicles 3:4 ) David died (B.C. 1015) at the age of seventy years, \"and was buried in the city of David.\" His tomb is still pointed out on Mount Zion.", "Both in his prophetical and in his regal character David was a type of the Messiah ( 1 Samuel 16:13 ). The book of Psalms commonly bears the title of the \"Psalms of David,\" from the circumstance that he was the largest contributor (about eighty psalms) to the collection. (See  PSALMS .)", "\"The greatness of David was felt when he was gone. He had lived in harmony with both the priesthood and the prophets; a sure sign that the spirit of his government had been throughly loyal to the higher aims of the theocracy. The nation had not been oppressed by him, but had been left in the free enjoyment of its ancient liberties. As far as his power went he had striven to act justly to all ( 2 Samuel 8:15 ). His weak indulgence to his sons, and his own great sin besides, had been bitterly atoned, and were forgotten at his death in the remembrance of his long-tried worth. He had reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem and seven and a half at Hebron ( 2 Samuel 5:5 ). Israel at his accession had reached the lowest point of national depression; its new-born unity rudely dissolved; its territory assailed by the Philistines. But he had left it an imperial power, with dominions like those of Egypt or Assyria. The sceptre of Solomon was already, before his father's death, owned from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates, and from the Orontes to the Red Sea.\", Geikie's Hours etc., iii."], "Word": "David", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "2": {"Definitions": ["well-beloved,  dear"], "Word": "David", "Dictionary": "Hitchcock's Names Dictionary"}, "3": {"Definitions": ["1.

At the first deportation of the Jews by Nebuchadnezzar (the kingdom of Israel had come to an end nearly a century before), or immediately after his victory over the Egyptians at the second battle of Carchemish, in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim (B.C. 606), Daniel and other three noble youths were carried off to Babylon, along with part of the vessels of the temple. There he was obliged to enter into the service of the king of Babylon, and in accordance with the custom of the age received the Chaldean name of Belteshazzar, i.e., \"prince of Bel,\" or \"Bel protect the king!\" His residence in Babylon was very probably in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar, now identified with a mass of shapeless mounds called the Kasr, on the right bank of the river.", "His training in the schools of the wise men in Babylon ( Daniel 1:4 ) was to fit him for service to the empire.

His habit of attention gained during his education in Jerusalem enabled him soon to master the wisdom and learning of the Chaldeans, and even to excel his compeers.", "At the close of his three years of discipline and training in the royal schools, Daniel was distinguished for his proficiency in the \"wisdom\" of his day, and was brought out into public life. He soon became known for his skill in the interpretation of dreams ( 1:17 ;  2:14 ), and rose to the rank of governor of the province of Babylon, and became \"chief of the governors\" (Chald. Rab-signin) over all the wise men of Babylon. He made known and also interpreted Nebuchadnezzar's dream; and many years afterwards, when he was now an old man, amid the alarm and consternation of the terrible night of Belshazzar's impious feast, he was called in at the instance of the queen-mother (perhaps Nitocris, the daughter of Nebuchadnezzar) to interpret the mysterious handwriting on the wall. He was rewarded with a purple robe and elevation to the rank of \"third ruler.\" The place of \"second ruler\" was held by Belshazzar as associated with his father, Nabonidus, on the throne ( 5:16 ). Daniel interpreted the handwriting, and \"in that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.\"", "After the taking of Babylon, Cyrus, who was now master of all Asia from India to the Dardanelles, placed Darius (q.v.), a Median prince, on the throne, during the two years of whose reign Daniel held the office of first of the \"three presidents\" of the empire, and was thus practically at the head of affairs, no doubt interesting himself in the prospects of the captive Jews (Daniel 9), whom he had at last the happiness of seeing restored to their own land, although he did not return with them, but remained still in Babylon. His fidelity to God exposed him to persecution, and he was cast into a den of lions, but was miraculously delivered; after which Darius issued a decree enjoining reverence for \"the God of Daniel\" ( 6:26 ). He \"prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian,\" whom he probably greatly influenced in the matter of the decree which put an end to the Captivity (B.C. 536).", "He had a series of prophetic visions vouch-safed to him which opened up the prospect of a glorious future for the people of God, and must have imparted peace and gladness to his spirit in his old age as he waited on at his post till the \"end of the days.\" The time and circumstances of his death are not recorded.

The writer is familiar both with the Hebrew and the Chaldee, passing from the one to the other just as his subject required. This is in strict accordance with the position of the author and of the people for whom his book was written.

Smerdis was a Margian, and therefore had no sympathy with Cyrus and Cambyses in the manner in which they had treated the Jews. He issued a decree prohibiting the restoration of the temple and of Jerusalem ( Ezra 4:17-22 ). But soon after his death and the accession of Darius, the Jews resumed their work, thinking that the edict of Smerdis would be now null and void, as Darius was in known harmony with the religious policy of Cyrus. The enemies of the Jews lost no time in bringing the matter under the notice of Darius, who caused search to be made for the decree of Cyrus (q.v.). It was not found at Babylon, but at Achmetha ( Ezra 6:2 ); and Darius forthwith issued a new decree, giving the Jews full liberty to prosecute their work, at the same time requiring the Syrian satrap and his subordinates to give them all needed help. It was with the army of this king that the Greeks fought the famous battle of Marathon (B.C. 490). During his reign the Jews enjoyed much peace and prosperity.

Heb. midbar, \"pasture-ground;\" an open tract for pasturage; a common ( Joel 2:22 ). The \"backside of the desert\" ( Exodus 3:1 ) is the west of the desert, the region behind a man, as the east is the region in front. The same Hebrew word is rendered \"wildernes,\" and is used of the country lying between Egypt and Palestine ( Genesis 21:14, 21 ;  Exodus 4:27 ;  19:2 ;  Joshua 1:4 ), the wilderness of the wanderings. It was a grazing tract, where the flocks and herds of the Israelites found pasturage during the whole of their journey to the Promised Land.", "The same Hebrew word is used also to denote the wilderness of Arabia, which in winter and early spring supplies good pasturage to the flocks of the nomad tribes than roam over it ( 1 Kings 9:18 ).", "The wilderness of Judah is the mountainous region along the western shore of the Dead Sea, where David fed his father's flocks ( 1 Samuel 17:28 ;  26:2 ). Thus in both of these instances the word denotes a country without settled inhabitants and without streams of water, but having good pasturage for cattle; a country of wandering tribes, as distinguished from that of a settled people ( Isaiah 35:1 ;  50:2 ;  Jeremiah 4:11 ). Such, also, is the meaning of the word \"wilderness\" in  Matthew 3:3 ;  15:33 ;  Luke 15:4 .", "2.  The translation of the Hebrew Aribah', \"an arid tract\" ( Isaiah 35:1, 6 ;  40:3 ;  41:19 ;  51:3 , etc.). The name Arabah is specially applied to the deep valley of the Jordan (the Ghor of the Arabs), which extends from the lake of Tiberias to the Elanitic gulf. While midbar denotes properly a pastoral region, arabah denotes a wilderness. It is also translated \"plains;\" as \"the plains of Jericho\" ( Joshua 5:10 ;  2 Kings 25:5 ), \"the plains of Moab\" ( Numbers 22:1 ;  Deuteronomy 34:1, 8 ), \"the plains of the wilderness\" ( 2 Samuel 17:16 ).", "3.  In the Revised Version of  Numbers 21:20  the Hebrew word jeshimon is properly rendered \"desert,\" meaning the waste tracts on both shores of the Dead Sea. This word is also rendered \"desert\" in  Psalms 78:40 ;  106:14 ;  Isaiah 43:19, 20 . It denotes a greater extent of uncultivated country than the other words so rendered. It is especially applied to the desert of the peninsula of Arabia ( Numbers 21:20 ;  23:28 ), the most terrible of all the deserts with which the Israelites were acquainted. It is called \"the desert\" in  Exodus 23:31 ;  Deuteronomy 11:24 . (See  JESHIMON .)", "4.  A dry place; hence a desolation ( Psalms 9:6 ), desolate ( Leviticus 26:34 ); the rendering of the Hebrew word horbah'. It is rendered \"desert\" only in  Psalms 102:6 ,  Isaiah 48:21 , and  Ezekiel 13:4 , where it means the wilderness of Sinai.", "5.  This word is the symbol of the Jewish church when they had forsaken God ( Isaiah 40:3 ). Nations destitute of the knowledge of God are called a \"wilderness\" ( 32:15 , midbar). It is a symbol of temptation, solitude, and persecution ( Isaiah 27:10 , midbar_;  33:9 , _arabah)."], "Word": "Desert", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "2": {"Definitions": ["An arid region bearing only a sparse vegetation Leviticus 16:22 ;  Deuteronomy 8:15 ;  Jeremiah 2:2 ;  Jeremiah 2:6 ;  Jeremiah 17:6", "Figurative Isaiah 35:1"], "Word": "Desert", "Dictionary": "Naves Topical Index"}, "3": {"Definitions": ["Not a stretch of sand, an utterly barren waste, but a wild, uninhabited region.

From May till October rain is unknown, the sun shining with unclouded brightness day after day. The heat becomes intense, the ground hard, and vegetation would perish but for the moist west winds that come each night from the sea. The bright skies cause the heat of the day to radiate very quickly into space, so that the nights are as cold as the day is the reverse, a peculiarity of climate from which poor Jacob suffered thousands of years ago ( Genesis 31:40 ). To this coldness of the night air the indispensable watering of all plant-life is due. The winds, loaded with moisture, are robbed of it as they pass over the land, the cold air condensing it into drops of water, which fall in a gracious rain of mist on every thirsty blade. In the morning the fog thus created rests like a sea over the plains, and far up the sides of the hills, which raise their heads above it like so many islands. At sunrise, however, the scene speedily changes. By the kindling light the mist is transformed into vast snow-white clouds, which presently break into separate masses and rise up the mountain-sides, to disappear in the blue above, dissipated by the increasing heat. These are the morning clouds and the early dew that go away' of which Hosea ( 6:4 ;  13:3 ) speaks so touchingly\" (Geikie's The Holy Land, etc., i., p. 72). Dew is a source of great fertility ( Genesis 27:28 ;  Deuteronomy 33:13 ;  Zechariah 8:12 ), and its withdrawal is regarded as a curse from God ( 2 Samuel 1:21 ;  1 Kings 17:1 ). It is the symbol of a multitude ( 2 Samuel 17:12 ;  Psalms 110:3 ); and from its refreshing influence it is an emblem of brotherly love and harmony ( Psalms 133:3 ), and of rich spiritual blessings ( Hosea 14:5 )."], "Word": "Dew", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "2": {"Definitions": ["A merciful providence Deuteronomy 33:13", "Forms imperceptibly 2 Samuel 17:12", "Forms in the night Job 29:19", "From the clouds Proverbs 3:20", "Called the dew of heaven Daniel 4:15", "Absence of 1 Kings 17:1", "Miraculous profusion and absence of Judges 6:36-40 Meteorology and Celestial Phenomena", "Figurative Psalms 110:3 ;  Isaiah 26:19 ;  Hosea 6:4 ;  Hosea 13:3 ;  Hosea 14:5"], "Word": "Dew", "Dictionary": "Naves Topical Index"}, "3": {"Definitions": ["This in the summer is so copious in Palestine that it supplies to some extent the absence of rain and becomes important to the agriculturist.

Materials used. The earliest and simplest an apron of fig-leaves sewed together ( Genesis 3:7 ); then skins of animals ( 3:21 ). Elijah's dress was probably the skin of a sheep ( 2 Kings 1:8 ). The Hebrews were early acquainted with the art of weaving hair into cloth ( Exodus 26:7 ;  35:6 ), which formed the sackcloth of mourners. This was the material of John the Baptist's robe ( Matthew 3:4 ). Wool was also woven into garments ( Leviticus 13:47 ;  Deuteronomy 22:11 ;  Ezekiel 34:3 ;  Job 31:20 ;  Proverbs 27:26 ). The Israelites probably learned the art of weaving linen when they were in Egypt ( 1 Chronicles 4:21 ). Fine linen was used in the vestments of the high priest ( Exodus 28:5 ), as well as by the rich ( Genesis 41:42 ;  Proverbs 31:22 ;  Luke 16:19 ). The use of mixed material, as wool and flax, was forbidden ( Leviticus 19:19 ;  Deuteronomy 22:11 ).", "2.  Colour. The prevailing colour was the natural white of the material used, which was sometimes rendered purer by the fuller's art ( Psalms 104:1, 2 ;  Isaiah 63:3 ;  Mark 9:3 ). The Hebrews were acquainted with the art of dyeing ( Genesis 37:3, 23 ). Various modes of ornamentation were adopted in the process of weaving ( Exodus 28:6 ;  26:1, 31 ;  35:25 ), and by needle-work ( Judges 5:30 ;  Psalms 45:13 ). Dyed robes were imported from foreign countries, particularly from Phoenicia ( Zephaniah 1:8 ). Purple and scarlet robes were the marks of the wealthy ( Luke 16:19 ;  2 Samuel 1:24 ).", "3.  Form. The robes of men and women were not very much different in form from each other. (a) The \"coat\" (kethoneth), of wool, cotton, or linen, was worn by both sexes. It was a closely-fitting garment, resembling in use and form our shirt ( John 19:23 ). It was kept close to the body by a girdle ( John 21:7 ). A person wearing this \"coat\" alone was described as naked ( 1 Samuel 19:24 ;  Isaiah 20:2 ;  2 Kings 6:30 ;  John 21:7 ); deprived of it he would be absolutely naked. (b) A linen cloth or wrapper (sadin) of fine linen, used somewhat as a night-shirt ( Mark 14:51 ). It is mentioned in  Judges 14:12, 13 , and rendered there \"sheets.\" (c) An upper tunic (meil), longer than the \"coat\" ( 1 Samuel 2:19 ;  24:4 ;  28:14 ). In  1 Samuel 28:14  it is the mantle in which Samuel was enveloped; in  1 Samuel 24:4  it is the \"robe\" under which Saul slept. The disciples were forbidden to wear two \"coats\" ( Matthew 10:10 ;  Luke 9:3 ). (d) The usual outer garment consisted of a piece of woollen cloth like a Scotch plaid, either wrapped round the body or thrown over the shoulders like a shawl, with the ends hanging down in front, or it might be thrown over the head so as to conceal the face ( 2 Samuel 15:30 ;  Esther 6:12 ). It was confined to the waist by a girdle, and the fold formed by the overlapping of the robe served as a pocket ( 2 Kings 4:39 ;  Psalms 79:12 ;  Haggai 2:12 ;  Proverbs 17:23 ;  21:14 ).", "Female dress. The \"coat\" was common to both sexes ( Song of Solomon 5:3 ). But peculiar to females were (1) the \"veil\" or \"wimple,\" a kind of shawl ( Ruth 3:15 ; rendered \"mantle,\" R.V.,  Isaiah 3:22 ); (2) the \"mantle,\" also a species of shawl ( Isaiah 3:22 ); (3) a \"veil,\" probably a light summer dress ( Genesis 24:65 ); (4) a \"stomacher,\" a holiday dress ( Isaiah 3:24 ). The outer garment terminated in an ample fringe or border, which concealed the feet ( Isaiah 47:2 ;  Jeremiah 13:22 ).", "The dress of the Persians is described in  Daniel 3:21 .", "The reference to the art of sewing are few, inasmuch as the garments generally came forth from the loom ready for being worn, and all that was required in the making of clothes devolved on the women of a family ( Proverbs 31:22 ;  Acts 9:39 ).", "Extravagance in dress is referred to in  Jeremiah 4:30 ;  Ezekiel 16:10 ;  Zephania 1:8  (R.V., \"foreign apparel\");  1 Timothy 2:9 ;  1 Peter 3:3 . Rending the robes was expressive of grief ( Genesis 37:29, 34 ), fear ( 1 Kings 21:27 ), indignation ( 2 Kings 5:7 ), or despair ( Judges 11:35 ;  Esther 4:1 ).", "Shaking the garments, or shaking the dust from off them, was a sign of renunciation ( Acts 18:6 ); wrapping them round the head, of awe ( 1 Kings 19:13 ) or grief ( 2 Samuel 15:30 ; casting them off, of excitement ( Acts 22:23 ); laying hold of them, of supplication ( 1 Samuel 15:27 ). In the case of travelling, the outer garments were girded up ( 1 Kings 18:46 ).

Three kinds of divination are mentioned in  Ezekiel 21:21 , by arrows, consulting with images (the teraphim), and by examining the entrails of animals sacrificed. The practice of this art seems to have been encouraged in ancient Egypt. Diviners also abounded among the aborigines of Canaan and the Philistines ( Isaiah 2:6 ; 1 Samuel 28). At a later period multitudes of magicians poured from Chaldea and Arabia into the land of Israel, and pursued their occupations ( Isaiah 8:19 ;  2 Kings 21:6 ;  2 Chronicles 33:6 ). This superstition widely spread, and in the time of the apostles there were \"vagabond Jews, exorcists\" ( Acts 19:13 ), and men like Simon Magus ( Acts 8:9 ), Bar-jesus ( 13:6, 8 ), and other jugglers and impostors ( 19:19 ;  2 Timothy 3:13 ).

( Isaiah 41:21-24 ;  44:7 ) Moses forbade every species of divination, because a prying into the future clouds the mind with superstition, and because it would have been an incentive to idolatry. But God supplied his people with substitutes for divination which would have rended it superfluous, and left them in no doubt as to his will in circumstances of danger, had they continued faithful. It was only when they were unfaithful that the revelation was withdrawn.

Materials used. The earliest and simplest an apron of fig-leaves sewed together ( Genesis 3:7 ); then skins of animals ( 3:21 ). Elijah's dress was probably the skin of a sheep ( 2 Kings 1:8 ). The Hebrews were early acquainted with the art of weaving hair into cloth ( Exodus 26:7 ;  35:6 ), which formed the sackcloth of mourners. This was the material of John the Baptist's robe ( Matthew 3:4 ). Wool was also woven into garments ( Leviticus 13:47 ;  Deuteronomy 22:11 ;  Ezekiel 34:3 ;  Job 31:20 ;  Proverbs 27:26 ). The Israelites probably learned the art of weaving linen when they were in Egypt ( 1 Chronicles 4:21 ). Fine linen was used in the vestments of the high priest ( Exodus 28:5 ), as well as by the rich ( Genesis 41:42 ;  Proverbs 31:22 ;  Luke 16:19 ). The use of mixed material, as wool and flax, was forbidden ( Leviticus 19:19 ;  Deuteronomy 22:11 ).", "2.  Colour. The prevailing colour was the natural white of the material used, which was sometimes rendered purer by the fuller's art ( Psalms 104:1, 2 ;  Isaiah 63:3 ;  Mark 9:3 ). The Hebrews were acquainted with the art of dyeing ( Genesis 37:3, 23 ). Various modes of ornamentation were adopted in the process of weaving ( Exodus 28:6 ;  26:1, 31 ;  35:25 ), and by needle-work ( Judges 5:30 ;  Psalms 45:13 ). Dyed robes were imported from foreign countries, particularly from Phoenicia ( Zephaniah 1:8 ). Purple and scarlet robes were the marks of the wealthy ( Luke 16:19 ;  2 Samuel 1:24 ).", "3.  Form. The robes of men and women were not very much different in form from each other. (a) The \"coat\" (kethoneth), of wool, cotton, or linen, was worn by both sexes. It was a closely-fitting garment, resembling in use and form our shirt ( John 19:23 ). It was kept close to the body by a girdle ( John 21:7 ). A person wearing this \"coat\" alone was described as naked ( 1 Samuel 19:24 ;  Isaiah 20:2 ;  2 Kings 6:30 ;  John 21:7 ); deprived of it he would be absolutely naked. (b) A linen cloth or wrapper (sadin) of fine linen, used somewhat as a night-shirt ( Mark 14:51 ). It is mentioned in  Judges 14:12, 13 , and rendered there \"sheets.\" (c) An upper tunic (meil), longer than the \"coat\" ( 1 Samuel 2:19 ;  24:4 ;  28:14 ). In  1 Samuel 28:14  it is the mantle in which Samuel was enveloped; in  1 Samuel 24:4  it is the \"robe\" under which Saul slept. The disciples were forbidden to wear two \"coats\" ( Matthew 10:10 ;  Luke 9:3 ). (d) The usual outer garment consisted of a piece of woollen cloth like a Scotch plaid, either wrapped round the body or thrown over the shoulders like a shawl, with the ends hanging down in front, or it might be thrown over the head so as to conceal the face ( 2 Samuel 15:30 ;  Esther 6:12 ). It was confined to the waist by a girdle, and the fold formed by the overlapping of the robe served as a pocket ( 2 Kings 4:39 ;  Psalms 79:12 ;  Haggai 2:12 ;  Proverbs 17:23 ;  21:14 ).", "Female dress. The \"coat\" was common to both sexes ( Song of Solomon 5:3 ). But peculiar to females were (1) the \"veil\" or \"wimple,\" a kind of shawl ( Ruth 3:15 ; rendered \"mantle,\" R.V.,  Isaiah 3:22 ); (2) the \"mantle,\" also a species of shawl ( Isaiah 3:22 ); (3) a \"veil,\" probably a light summer dress ( Genesis 24:65 ); (4) a \"stomacher,\" a holiday dress ( Isaiah 3:24 ). The outer garment terminated in an ample fringe or border, which concealed the feet ( Isaiah 47:2 ;  Jeremiah 13:22 ).", "The dress of the Persians is described in  Daniel 3:21 .", "The reference to the art of sewing are few, inasmuch as the garments generally came forth from the loom ready for being worn, and all that was required in the making of clothes devolved on the women of a family ( Proverbs 31:22 ;  Acts 9:39 ).", "Extravagance in dress is referred to in  Jeremiah 4:30 ;  Ezekiel 16:10 ;  Zephania 1:8  (R.V., \"foreign apparel\");  1 Timothy 2:9 ;  1 Peter 3:3 . Rending the robes was expressive of grief ( Genesis 37:29, 34 ), fear ( 1 Kings 21:27 ), indignation ( 2 Kings 5:7 ), or despair ( Judges 11:35 ;  Esther 4:1 ).", "Shaking the garments, or shaking the dust from off them, was a sign of renunciation ( Acts 18:6 ); wrapping them round the head, of awe ( 1 Kings 19:13 ) or grief ( 2 Samuel 15:30 ; casting them off, of excitement ( Acts 22:23 ); laying hold of them, of supplication ( 1 Samuel 15:27 ). In the case of travelling, the outer garments were girded up ( 1 Kings 18:46 ).

Three kinds of divination are mentioned in  Ezekiel 21:21 , by arrows, consulting with images (the teraphim), and by examining the entrails of animals sacrificed. The practice of this art seems to have been encouraged in ancient Egypt. Diviners also abounded among the aborigines of Canaan and the Philistines ( Isaiah 2:6 ; 1 Samuel 28). At a later period multitudes of magicians poured from Chaldea and Arabia into the land of Israel, and pursued their occupations ( Isaiah 8:19 ;  2 Kings 21:6 ;  2 Chronicles 33:6 ). This superstition widely spread, and in the time of the apostles there were \"vagabond Jews, exorcists\" ( Acts 19:13 ), and men like Simon Magus ( Acts 8:9 ), Bar-jesus ( 13:6, 8 ), and other jugglers and impostors ( 19:19 ;  2 Timothy 3:13 ).

There was divination by lot, by which, when resorted to in matters of moment, and with solemnity, God intimated his will ( Joshua 7:13 ). The land of Canaan was divided by lot ( Numbers 26:55, 56 ); Achan's guilt was detected ( Joshua 7:16-19 ), Saul was elected king ( 1 Samuel 10:20, 21 ), and Matthias chosen to the apostleship, by the solem lot ( Acts 1:26 ).

This is illustrated in the history of Joseph ( Genesis 41:25-32 ) and of Daniel ( 2:27 ;  4:19-28 ).", "3.

He also communed with men from above the mercy-seat ( Exodus 25:22 ), and at the door of the tabernacle ( Exodus 29:42, 43 ).", "5.

( Isaiah 41:21-24 ;  44:7 ) Moses forbade every species of divination, because a prying into the future clouds the mind with superstition, and because it would have been an incentive to idolatry. But God supplied his people with substitutes for divination which would have rended it superfluous, and left them in no doubt as to his will in circumstances of danger, had they continued faithful. It was only when they were unfaithful that the revelation was withdrawn. ( 1 Samuel 28:6 ;  2 Samuel 2:1 ;  5:23 ) etc. Superstition not unfrequently goes hand in hand with skepticism, and hence, amid the general infidelity prevalent throughout the Roman empire at our Lord's coming, imposture was rampant.

The Arabs call it Bahr Lut, i.e., the Sea of Lot. It lies about 16 miles in a straight line to the east of Jerusalem. Its surface is 1,292 feet below the surface of the Mediterranean Sea. It covers an area of about 300 square miles. Its depth varies from 1,310 to 11 feet. From various phenomena that have been observed, its bottom appears to be still subsiding. It is about 53 miles long, and of an average breadth of 10 miles. It has no outlet, the great heat of that region causing such rapid evaporation that its average depth, notwithstanding the rivers that run into it (see  JORDAN ), is maintained with little variation. The Jordan alone discharges into it no less than six million tons of water every twenty-four hours.", "The waters of the Dead Sea contain 24.6 per cent. of mineral salts, about seven times as much as in ordinary sea-water; thus they are unusually buoyant. Chloride of magnesium is most abundant; next to that chloride of sodium (common salt). But terraces of alluvial deposits in the deep valley of the Jordan show that formerly one great lake extended from the Waters of Merom to the foot of the watershed in the Arabah. The waters were then about 1,400 feet above the present level of the Dead Sea, or slightly above that of the Mediterranean, and at that time were much less salt.", "Nothing living can exist in this sea. \"The fish carried down by the Jordan at once die, nor can even mussels or corals live in it; but it is a fable that no bird can fly over it, or that there are no living creatures on its banks. Dr. Tristram found on the shores three kinds of kingfishers, gulls, ducks, and grebes, which he says live on the fish which enter the sea in shoals, and presently die. He collected one hundred and eighteen species of birds, some new to science, on the shores, or swimming or flying over the waters. The cane-brakes which fringe it at some parts are the homes of about forty species of mammalia, several of them animals unknown in England; and innumerable tropical or semi-tropical plants perfume the atmosphere wherever fresh water can reach. The climate is perfect and most delicious, and indeed there is perhaps no place in the world where a sanatorium could be established with so much prospect of benefit as at Ain Jidi (Engedi).\", Geikie's Hours, etc."], "Word": "Dead Sea", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "4": {"Definitions": ["Lies southeast of Jerusalem.", "Called Salt Sea Genesis 14:3 ;  Numbers 34:12", "Called Sea of the Plain Deuteronomy 3:17 ;  Deuteronomy 4:49 ;  Joshua 3:16", "Called East Sea Joel 2:20", "Called Former Sea Zech 14:8", "Prophecy concerning Ezekiel 47:7-10 ;  Ezekiel 47:18"], "Word": "Dead Sea", "Dictionary": "Naves Topical Index"}, "5": {"Definitions": ["This name nowhere occurs in the Bible, and appears not to have existed until the second century after Christ.
