The Greek word so rendered is apolutrosis, a word occurring nine times in Scripture, and always with the idea of a ransom or price paid, i.e., redemption by a lutron (see  Matthew 20:28 ;  Mark 10:45 ). There are instances in the LXX. Version of the Old Testament of the use of lutron in man's relation to man ( Leviticus 19:20 ;  25:51 ;  Exodus 21:30 ;  Numbers 35:31, 32 ;  Isaiah 45:13 ;  Proverbs 6:35 ), and in the same sense of man's relation to God ( Numbers 3:49 ;  18:15 ).", "There are many passages in the New Testament which represent Christ's sufferings under the idea of a ransom or price, and the result thereby secured is a purchase or redemption (comp.

The idea running through all these texts, however various their reference, is that of payment made for our redemption. The debt against us is not viewed as simply cancelled, but is fully paid. Christ's blood or life, which he surrendered for them, is the \"ransom\" by which the deliverance of his people from the servitude of sin and from its penal consequences is secured. It is the plain doctrine of Scripture that \"Christ saves us neither by the mere exercise of power, nor by his doctrine, nor by his example, nor by the moral influence which he exerted, nor by any subjective influence on his people, whether natural or mystical, but as a satisfaction to divine justice, as an expiation for sin, and as a ransom from the curse and authority of the law, thus reconciling us to God by making it consistent with his perfection to exercise mercy toward sinners\" (Hodge's Systematic Theology)."], "Word": "Redemption", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "2": {"Definitions": ["Of persons or property Leviticus 25:25-34 ;  Leviticus 27:2-33 ;  Ruth 4:3-10", "Redemption money paid to priests Numbers 3:46-51", "Of firstborn Firstborn", "Of land Jubilee", "Of our souls", "General references Psalms 111:9 ;  Psalms 130:7 ;  Matthew 20:28 ;  Mark 10:45 ;  Luke 2:38 ;  Acts 20:28 ;  Romans 3:24-26 ;  1 Corinthians 1:30 ;  1 Corinthians 6:20 ;  1 Corinthians 7:23 ;  Galatians 1:4 ;  Galatians 2:20 ;  Galatians 4:4-5 ;  Ephesians 1:7 ;  Ephesians 5:2 ;  Colossians 1:14 ;  Colossians 1:20-22 ;  1 Timothy 2:6 ;  Titus 2:14 ;  Hebrews 9:12 ;  Hebrews 9:15 ;  1 Peter 1:18-19 ;  Revelation 5:9-10 Atonement ;  Ransom"], "Word": "Redemption", "Dictionary": "Naves Topical Index"}, "3": {"Definitions": ["REDEMP'TION ,  noun   [Latin  redemptio.

Here the bedstead of Og was preserved ( Deuteronomy 3:11 ), perhaps as a trophy of some victory gained by the Ammonites over the king of Bashan. After David had subdued all their allies in a great war, he sent Joab with a strong force to take their city. For two years it held out against its assailants. It was while his army was engaged in this protracted siege that David was guilty of that deed of shame which left a blot on his character and cast a gloom over the rest of his life. At length, having taken the \"royal city\" (or the \"city of waters,\"  2 Samuel 12:27 , i.e., the lower city on the river, as distinguished from the citadel), Joab sent for David to direct the final assault ( 11:1 ;  12:26-31 ). The city was given up to plunder, and the people were ruthlessly put to death, and \"thus did he with all the cities of the children of Ammon.\" The destruction of Rabbath was the last of David's conquests. His kingdom now reached its farthest limits ( 2 Samuel 8:1-15 ;  1 Chronicles 18:1-15 ).

He was the son of Naamah \"the Ammonitess,\" some well-known Ammonitish princess ( 1 Kings 14:21 ;  2 Chronicles 12:13 ). He was forty-one years old when he ascended the throne, and he reigned seventeen years (B.C. 975-958). Although he was acknowledged at once as the rightful heir to the throne, yet there was a strongly-felt desire to modify the character of the government. The burden of taxation to which they had been subjected during Solomon's reign was very oppressive, and therefore the people assembled at Shechem and demanded from the king an alleviation of their burdens. He went to meet them at Shechem, and heard their demands for relief ( 1 Kings 12:4 ). After three days, having consulted with a younger generation of courtiers that had grown up around him, instead of following the advice of elders, he answered the people haughtily (6-15). \"The king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the Lord\" (comp.  11:31 ). This brought matters speedily to a crisis. The terrible cry was heard (comp.  2 Samuel 20:1 ):", "\"What portion have we in David? Neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: To your tents, O Israel: Now see to thine own house, David\" ( 1 Kings 12:16 ).", "And now at once the kingdom was rent in twain. Rehoboam was appalled, and tried concessions, but it was too late (18). The tribe of Judah, Rehoboam's own tribe, alone remained faithful to him. Benjamin was reckoned along with Judah, and these two tribes formed the southern kingdom, with Jerusalem as its capital; while the northern ten tribes formed themselves into a separate kingdom, choosing Jeroboam as their king. Rehoboam tried to win back the revolted ten tribes by making war against them, but he was prevented by the prophet Shemaiah (21-24;  2 Chronicles 11:1-4)  from fulfilling his purpose. (See  JEROBOAM .)", "In the fifth year of Rehoboam's reign, Shishak (q.v.), one of the kings of Egypt of the Assyrian dynasty, stirred up, no doubt, by Jeroboam his son-in-law, made war against him. Jerusalem submitted to the invader, who plundered the temple and virtually reduced the kingdom to the position of a vassal of Egypt ( 1 Kings 14:25, 26 ;  2 Chronicles 12:5-9) . A remarkable memorial of this invasion has been discovered at Karnac, in Upper Egypt, in certain sculptures on the walls of a small temple there.

He went to meet them at Shechem, and heard their demands for relief ( 1 Kings 12:4 ). After three days, having consulted with a younger generation of courtiers that had grown up around him, instead of following the advice of elders, he answered the people haughtily (6-15). \"The king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the Lord\" (comp.  11:31 ).
