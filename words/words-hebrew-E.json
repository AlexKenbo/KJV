It is a wild and rugged region, traversed by fruitful valleys. Its old capital was Bozrah ( Isaiah 63:1 ). The early inhabitants of the land were Horites.

But they regained again their independence, and in later years, during the decline of the Jewish kingdom ( 2 Kings 16:6 ; R.V. marg., \"Edomites\"), made war against Israel.

It embraced the narrow mountainous tract (about 100 miles long by 20 broad) extending along the eastern side of the Arabah from the northern end of the Gulf of Elath to near the southern end of the Dead Sea.

For their cruelty at this time they were fearfully denounced by the later prophets. ( Isaiah 34:5-8 ;  63:1-4 ;  Jeremiah 49:17 ) After this they settled in southern Palestine, and for more than four centuries continued to prosper. But during the warlike rule of the Maccabees they were again completely subdued, and even forced to conform to Jewish laws and rites, and submit to the government of Jewish prefects.

It also denoted a political office ( Numbers 22:7 ). The \"elders of Israel\" held a rank among the people indicative of authority. Moses opened his commission to them ( Exodus 3:16 ). They attended Moses on all important occasions. Seventy of them attended on him at the giving of the law ( Exodus 24:1 ). Seventy also were selected from the whole number to bear with Moses the burden of the people ( Numbers 11:16, 17 ). The \"elder\" is the keystone of the social and political fabric wherever the patriarchal system exists. At the present day this is the case among the Arabs, where the sheik (i.e., \"the old man\") is the highest authority in the tribe. The body of the \"elders\" of Israel were the representatives of the people from the very first, and were recognized as such by Moses. All down through the history of the Jews we find mention made of the elders as exercising authority among the people. They appear as governors ( Deuteronomy 31:28 ), as local magistrates ( 16:18 ), administering justice ( 19:12 ). They were men of extensive influence ( 1 Samuel 30:26-31 ). In New Testament times they also appear taking an active part in public affairs ( Matthew 16:21 ;  21:23 ;  26:59 ).", "The Jewish eldership was transferred from the old dispensation to the new. \"The creation of the office of elder is nowhere recorded in the New Testament, as in the case of deacons and apostles, because the latter offices were created to meet new and special emergencies, while the former was transmitted from the earlies times.

Everywhere in the New Testament bishop and presbyter are titles given to one and the same officer of the Christian church.

( Genesis 24:2 ;  50:7 ;  2 Samuel 12:17 ;  Ezekiel 27:9 ) As betokening a political office, it applied not only to the Hebrews, but also to the Egyptians, ( Genesis 50:7 ) the Moabites and the Midianites. ( Numbers 22:7 ) The earliest notice of the elders acting in concert as a political body is at the time of the Exodus. They were the representatives of the people, so much so that  elders  and  people  are occasionally used as equivalent terms; comp. ( Joshua 24:1 ) with ( Joshua 24:2,19,21 ) and ( 1 Samuel 8:4 ) with ( 1 Samuel 8:7,10,19 ) Their authority was undefined, and extended to all matters concerning the public weal. Their number and influence may be inferred from ( 1 Samuel 30:26 )ff. They retained their position under all the political changes which the Jews underwent. The seventy elders mentioned in Exodus and Numbers were a sort of governing body, a parliament, and the origin of the tribunal of seventy elders called the Sanhedrin or Council.

There is mention made of a town called Thisbe, south of Kadesh, but it is impossible to say whether this was the place referred to in the name given to the prophet.", "Having delivered his message to Ahab, he retired at the command of God to a hiding-place by the brook Cherith, beyond Jordan, where he was fed by ravens. When the brook dried up God sent him to the widow of Zarephath, a city of Zidon, from whose scanty store he was supported for the space of two years. During this period the widow's son died, and was restored to life by Elijah ( 1 Kings 17:2-24 ).", "During all these two years a famine prevailed in the land. At the close of this period of retirement and of preparation for his work (comp.  Galatians 1:17, 18 ) Elijah met Obadiah, one of Ahab's officers, whom he had sent out to seek for pasturage for the cattle, and bade him go and tell his master that Elijah was there. The king came and met Elijah, and reproached him as the troubler of Israel. It was then proposed that sacrifices should be publicly offered, for the purpose of determining whether Baal or Jehovah were the true God. This was done on Carmel, with the result that the people fell on their faces, crying, \"The Lord, he is the God.\" Thus was accomplished the great work of Elijah's ministry. The prophets of Baal were then put to death by the order of Elijah. Not one of them escaped. Then immediately followed rain, according to the word of Elijah, and in answer to his prayer ( James 5:18 ).", "Jezebel, enraged at the fate that had befallen her priests of Baal, threatened to put Elijah to death ( 1 Kings 19:1-13 ). He therefore fled in alarm to Beersheba, and thence went alone a day's journey into the wilderness, and sat down in despondency under a juniper tree. As he slept an angel touched him, and said unto him, \"Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee.\" He arose and found a cake and a cruse of water. Having partaken of the provision thus miraculously supplied, he went forward on his solitary way for forty days and forty nights to Horeb, the mount of God, where he took up his abode in a cave. Here the Lord appeared unto him and said, \"What dost thou here, Elijah?\" In answer to his despondent words God manifests to him his glory, and then directs him to return to Damascus and anoint Hazael king over Syria, and Jehu king over Israel, and Elisha to be prophet in his room ( 1 Kings 19:13-21 ; comp.  2 Kings 8:7-15 ;  9:1-10 ).", "Some six years after this he warned Ahab and Jezebel of the violent deaths they would die ( 1 Kings 21:19-24 ;  22:38 ). He also, four years afterwards, warned Ahaziah (q.v.), who had succeeded his father Ahab, of his approaching death ( 2 Kings 1:1-16 ). (See  NABOTH .) During these intervals he probably withdrew to some quiet retirement, no one knew where. His interview with Ahaziah's messengers on the way to Ekron, and the account of the destruction of his captains with their fifties, suggest the idea that he may have been in retirement at this time on Mount Carmel.", "The time now drew near when he was to be taken up into heaven ( 2 Kings 2:1-12 ). He had a presentiment of what was awaiting him. He went down to Gilgal, where was a school of the prophets, and where his successor Elisha, whom he had anointed some years before, resided. Elisha was solemnized by the thought of his master's leaving him, and refused to be parted from him. \"They two went on,\" and came to Bethel and Jericho, and crossed the Jordan, the waters of which were \"divided hither and thither\" when smitten with Elijah's mantle. Arrived at the borders of Gilead, which Elijah had left many years before, it \"came to pass as they still went on and talked\" they were suddenly separated by a chariot and horses of fire; and \"Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven, \"Elisha receiving his mantle, which fell from him as he ascended.", "No one of the old prophets is so frequently referred to in the New Testament. The priests and Levites said to the Baptist ( John 1:25 ), \"Why baptizest thou, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias?\" Paul ( Romans 11:2 ) refers to an incident in his history to illustrate his argument that God had not cast away his people. James ( 5:17 ) finds in him an illustration of the power of prayer. (See also  Luke 4:25 ;  9:54 .) He was a type of John the Baptist in the sternness and power of his reproofs ( Luke 9:8 ). He was the Elijah that \"must first come\" ( Matthew 11:11, 14 ), the forerunner of our Lord announced by Malachi. Even outwardly the Baptist corresponded so closely to the earlier prophet that he might be styled a second Elijah. In him we see \"the same connection with a wild and wilderness country; the same long retirement in the desert; the same sudden, startling entrance on his work ( 1 Kings 17:1 ;  Luke 3:2 ); even the same dress, a hairy garment, and a leathern girdle about the loins ( 2 Kings 1:8 ;  Matthew 3:4 ).\"", "How deep the impression was which Elijah made \"on the mind of the nation may be judged from the fixed belief, which rested on the words of Malachi ( 4:5, 6 ), which many centuries after prevailed that he would again appear for the relief and restoration of the country. Each remarkable person as he arrives on the scene, be his habits and characteristics what they may, the stern John equally with his gentle Successor, is proclaimed to be Elijah ( Matthew 11:13, 14 ;  16:14 ;  17:10 ;  Mark 9:11 ;  15:35 ;  Luke 9:7, 8 ;  John 1:21 ). His appearance in glory on the mount of transfiguration does not seem to have startled the disciples. They were sore afraid,' but not apparently surprised.\"", "2.  The Elijah spoken of in  2 Chronicles 21:12-15  is by some supposed to be a different person from the foregoing. He lived in the time of Jehoram, to whom he sent a letter of warning (comp.  1 Chronicles 28:19 ;  Jeremiah 36 ), and acted as a prophet in Judah; while the Tishbite was a prophet of the northern kingdom. But there does not seem any necessity for concluding that the writer of this letter was some other Elijah than the Tishbite. It may be supposed either that Elijah anticipated the character of Jehoram, and so wrote the warning message, which was preserved in the schools of the prophets till Jehoram ascended the throne after the Tishbite's translation, or that the translation did not actually take place till after the accession of Jehoram to the throne ( 2 Chronicles 21:12 ;  2 Kings 8:16 ). The events of 2 Kings 2 may not be recorded in chronological order, and thus there may be room for the opinion that Elijah was still alive in the beginning of Jehoram's reign."], "Word": "Elijah", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "2": {"Definitions": ["God the Lord,  the strong Lord"], "Word": "Elijah", "Dictionary": "Hitchcock's Names Dictionary"}, "3": {"Definitions": ["1.

Of his appearance as he \"stood before\" Ahab (B.C. 910) with the suddenness of motion to this day characteristic of the Bedouins from his native hills, we can perhaps realize something from the touches, few but strong, of the narrative. His chief characteristic was his hair, long and thick, and hanging down his back. His ordinary clothing consisted of a girdle of skin round his loins, which he tightened when about to move quickly. ( 1 Kings 18:46 ) But in addition to this he occasionally wore the \"mantle\" or cape of sheepskin which has supplied us with one of our most familiar figures of speech. His introduction, in what we may call the first act of his life, is the most startling description. He suddenly appears before Ahab, prophesies a three-years drought in Isr'l, and proclaims the vengeance of Jehovah for the apostasy of the king. Obliged to flee from the vengeance of king, or more probably of the queen (comp. ( 1 Kings 19:2 ) he was directed to the brook Cherith. There in the hollow of the torrent bed he remained, supported in the miraculous manner with which we are all familiar, till the failing of the brook obliged him to forsake it. His next refuge was at Zarephath. Here in the house of the widow woman Elijah performed the miracles of prolonging the oil and the meal, and restored the son of the widow to life after his apparent death. 1 Kings 17. In this or some other retreat an interval of more than two years must have elapsed. The drought continued, and at last the full horrors of famine, caused by the failure of the crops, descended on Samaria. Again Elijah suddenly appears before Ahab. There are few more sublime stories in history than the account of the succeeding events", "with the servant of Jehovah and his single attendant on the one hand, and the 850 prophets of Baal on the other; the altars, the descending fire of Jehovah consuming both sacrifice and altar; the rising storm, and the ride across the plain to Jezreel. 1 Kings 18. Jezebel vows vengeance, and again Elijah takes refuge in flight into the wilderness, where he is again miraculously fed, and goes forward, in the strength of that food, a journey of forty days to the mount of God, even to Horeb, where he takes refuge in a cave, and witnesses a remarkable vision of Jehovah. ( 1 Kings 19:9-18 ) He receives the divine communication, and sets forth in search of Elisha, whom he finds ploughing in the field, and anoints him prophet in his place. ch. 19. For a time little is heard of Elijah, and Ahab and Jezebel probably believed they had seen the last of him. But after the murder of Naboth, Elijah, who had received an intimation from Jehovah of what was taking place, again suddenly appears before the king, and then follow Elijah's fearful denunciation of Ahab and Jezebel, which may possibly be recovered by putting together the words recalled by Jehu, ( 2 Kings 9:26,36,37 ) and those given in ( 1 Kings 21:19-25 ) A space of three or four years now elapses (comp. ( 1 Kings 22:1,51 ;  2 Kings 1:17 ) before we again catch a glimpse of Elijah. Ahaziah is on his death-bed, ( 1 Kings 22:51 ;  2 Kings 1:1,2 ) and sends to an oracle or shrine of Baal to ascertain the issue of his illness; but Elijah suddenly appears on the path of the messengers, without preface or inquiry utters his message of death, and as rapidly disappears. The wrathful king sends two bands of soldiers to seize Elijah, and they are consumed with fire; but finally the prophet goes down and delivers to Ahaziah's face the message of death. No long after Elijah sent a message to Jehoram denouncing his evil doings, and predicting his death. ( 2 Chronicles 21:12-15 ) It was at Gilgal", "probably on the western edge of the hills of Ephraim", "that the prophet received the divine intimation that his departure was at hand. He was at the time with Elisha, who seems now to have become his constant companion, and who would not consent to leave him. \"And it came to pass as they still went on and talked, that, behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.\" (B.C. 896.) Fifty men of the sons of the prophets ascended the abrupt heights behind the town, and witnessed the scene. How deep was the impression which he made on the mind of the nation may be judged of from the fixed belief which many centuries after prevailed that Elijah would again appear for the relief and restoration of his country, as Malachi prophesied.

His name first occurs in the command given to Elijah to anoint him as his successor ( 1 Kings 19:16 ). This was the only one of the three commands then given to Elijah which he accomplished. On his way from Sinai to Damascus he found Elisha at his native place engaged in the labours of the field, ploughing with twelve yoke of oxen. He went over to him, threw over his shoulders his rough mantle, and at once adopted him as a son, and invested him with the prophetical office (comp.  Luke 9:61, 62 ). Elisha accepted the call thus given (about four years before the death of Ahab), and for some seven or eight years became the close attendant on Elijah till he was parted from him and taken up into heaven. During all these years we hear nothing of Elisha except in connection with the closing scenes of Elijah's life. After Elijah, Elisha was accepted as the leader of the sons of the prophets, and became noted in Israel. He possessed, according to his own request, \"a double portion\" of Elijah's spirit ( 2 Kings 2:9 ); and for the long period of about sixty years (B.C. 892-832) held the office of \"prophet in Israel\" ( 2 Kings 5:8 ).", "After Elijah's departure, Elisha returned to Jericho, and there healed the spring of water by casting salt into it ( 2 Kings 2:21 ). We next find him at Bethel ( 2:23 ), where, with the sternness of his master, he cursed the youths who came out and scoffed at him as a prophet of God: \"Go up, thou bald head.\" The judgment at once took effect, and God terribly visited the dishonour done to his prophet as dishonour done to himself.

Thus the three commands given to Elijah ( 9:1-10 ) were at length carried out.", "We do not again read of him till we find him on his death-bed in his own house ( 2 Kings 13:14-19 ).

The earliest mention of his name is in the command to Elijah in the cave at Horeb. ( 1 Kings 19:16,17 ) (B.C. about 900.) Elijah sets forth to obey the command, and comes upon his successor engaged in ploughing. He crosses to him and throws over his shoulders the rough mantle", "a token at once of investiture with the prophet's office and of adoption as a son. Elisha delayed merely to give the farewell kiss to his father and mother and preside at a parting feast with his people, and then followed the great prophet on his northward road. We hear nothing more of Elisha for eight years, until the translation of his master, when he reappears, to become the most prominent figure in the history of his country during the rest of his long life. In almost every respect Elisha presents the most complete contrast to Elijah. Elijah was a true Bedouin child of the desert. If he enters a city it is only to deliver his message of fire and be gone. Elisha, on the other hand, is a civilized man, an inhabitant of cities. His dress was the ordinary garment of an Isr'lite, the  beged  , probably similar in form to the long  abbeyeh  of the modern Syrians. ( 2 Kings 2:12 ) His hair was worn trimmed behind, in contrast to the disordered locks of Elijah, and he used a walking-staff, ( 2 Kings 4:29 ) of the kind ordinarily carried by grave or aged citizens. ( Zechariah 8:4 ) After the departure of his master, Elisha returned to dwell at Jericho, ( 2 Kings 2:18 ) where he miraculously purified the springs. We next meet with Elisha at Bethel, in the heart of the country, on his way from Jericho to Mount Carmel. ( 2 Kings 2:23 ) The mocking children, Elisha's curse and the catastrophe which followed are familiar to all. Later he extricates Jehoram king of Isr'l, and the kings of Judah and Edom, from their difficulty in the campaign against Moab arising from want of water. ( 2 Kings 3:4-27 ) Then he multiplies the widow's oil. ( 2 Kings 4:5 ) The next occurrence is at Shunem, where he is hospitably entertained by a woman of substance, whose son dies, and is brought to life again by Elisha. ( 2 Kings 4:8-37 ) Then at Gilgal he purifies the deadly pottage, ( 2 Kings 4:38-41 ) and multiplies the loaves. ( 2 Kings 4:42-44 ) The simple records of these domestic incidents amongst the sons of the prophets are now interrupted by an occurrence of a more important character. ( 2 Kings 5:1-27 ) The chief captain of the army of Syria, Naaman, is attacked with leprosy, and is sent by an Isr'lite maid to the prophet Elisha, who directs him to dip seven times in the Jordan, which he does and is healed, ( 2 Kings 5:1-14 ) while Naaman's servant, Gehazi, he strikes with leprosy for his unfaithfulness. ch. ( 2 Kings 5:20-27 ) Again the scene changes. It is probably at Jericho that Elisha causes the iron axe to swim. ( 2 Kings 6:1-7 ) A band of Syrian marauders are sent to seize him, but are struck blind, and he misleads them to Samaria, where they find themselves int he presence of the Isr'lite king and his troops. ( 2 Kings 6:8-23 ) During the famine in Samaria, ( 2 Kings 6:24-33 ) he prophesied incredible plenty, ch. ( 2 Kings 7:1-2 ) which was soon fulfilled. ch. ( 2 Kings 7:3-20 ) We next find the prophet at Damascus. Benhadad the king is sick, and sends to Elisha by Haz'l to know the result. Elisha prophesies the king's death, and announces to Haz'l that he is to succeed to the throne. ( 2 Kings 8:7,15 ) Finally this prophet of God, after having filled the position for sixty years, is found on his death-bed in his own house. ( 2 Kings 13:14-19 ) The power of the prophet, however, does not terminate with his death. Even in the tomb he restores the dead to life. ch.

When the ark was removed from Shiloh to Zion the power of Ephraim was humbled.\"", "Among the causes which operated to bring about the disruption of Israel was Ephraim's jealousy of the growing power of Judah. From the settlement of Canaan till the time of David and Solomon, Ephraim had held the place of honour among the tribes. It occupied the central and fairest portions of the land, and had Shiloh and Shechem within its borders. But now when Jerusalem became the capital of the kingdom, and the centre of power and worship for the whole nation of Israel, Ephraim declined in influence. The discontent came to a crisis by Rehoboam's refusal to grant certain redresses that were demanded (1 Kings 12)."], "Word": "Ephraim, the Tribe of", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "11": {"Definitions": ["a wood, or rather a forest, on the east of Jordan, in which the fatal battle was fought between the armies of David and of Absalom.

They attended Moses on all important occasions. Seventy of them attended on him at the giving of the law ( Exodus 24:1 ). Seventy also were selected from the whole number to bear with Moses the burden of the people ( Numbers 11:16, 17 ). The \"elder\" is the keystone of the social and political fabric wherever the patriarchal system exists. At the present day this is the case among the Arabs, where the sheik (i.e., \"the old man\") is the highest authority in the tribe. The body of the \"elders\" of Israel were the representatives of the people from the very first, and were recognized as such by Moses. All down through the history of the Jews we find mention made of the elders as exercising authority among the people. They appear as governors ( Deuteronomy 31:28 ), as local magistrates ( 16:18 ), administering justice ( 19:12 ). They were men of extensive influence ( 1 Samuel 30:26-31 ).

Everywhere in the New Testament bishop and presbyter are titles given to one and the same officer of the Christian church.

( Genesis 24:2 ;  50:7 ;  2 Samuel 12:17 ;  Ezekiel 27:9 ) As betokening a political office, it applied not only to the Hebrews, but also to the Egyptians, ( Genesis 50:7 ) the Moabites and the Midianites. ( Numbers 22:7 ) The earliest notice of the elders acting in concert as a political body is at the time of the Exodus. They were the representatives of the people, so much so that  elders  and  people  are occasionally used as equivalent terms; comp.

Their number and influence may be inferred from ( 1 Samuel 30:26 )ff. They retained their position under all the political changes which the Jews underwent. The seventy elders mentioned in Exodus and Numbers were a sort of governing body, a parliament, and the origin of the tribunal of seventy elders called the Sanhedrin or Council.

(See  ISRAEL, KINGDOM OF .)", "2.  Of the kingdom of the two tribes, the kingdom of Judah. Nebuchadnezzar, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim ( Jeremiah 25:1 ), invaded Judah, and carried away some royal youths, including Daniel and his companions (B.C. 606), together with the sacred vessels of the temple ( 2 Chronicles 36:7 ;  Daniel 1:2 ). In B.C. 598 ( Jeremiah 52:28 ;  2 Kings 24:12 ), in the beginning of Jehoiachin's reign ( 2 Kings 24:8 ), Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive 3,023 eminent Jews, including the king ( 2 Chronicles 36:10 ), with his family and officers ( 2 Kings 24:12 ), and a large number of warriors (16), with very many persons of note (14), and artisans (16), leaving behind only those who were poor and helpless. This was the first general deportation to Babylon.", "In B.C. 588, after the revolt of Zedekiah (q.v.), there was a second general deportation of Jews by Nebuchadnezzar ( Jeremiah 52:29 ;  2 Kings 25:8 ), including 832 more of the principal men of the kingdom. He carried away also the rest of the sacred vessels ( 2 Chronicles 36:18 ).

The entire number Nebuchadnezzar carried captive was 4,600 heads of families with their wives and children and dependants ( Jeremiah 52:30 ;  43:5-7 ;  2 Chronicles 36:20 , etc.). Thus the exiles formed a very considerable community in Babylon.", "When Cyrus granted permission to the Jews to return to their own land ( Ezra 1:5 ;  7:13 ), only a comparatively small number at first availed themselves of the privilege. It cannot be questioned that many belonging to the kingdom of Israel ultimately joined the Jews under Ezra, Zerubbabel, and Nehemiah, and returned along with them to Jerusalem ( Jeremiah 50:4, 5, 17-20 , 33-35).", "Large numbers had, however, settled in the land of Babylon, and formed numerous colonies in different parts of the kingdom.

Two parent eagles were teaching their offspring, two young birds, the maneuvers of flight. They began by rising from the top of the mountain in the eye of the sun. It was about mid-day, and bright for the climate. They at first made small circles, and the young birds imitated them. They paused on their wings, waiting till they had made their flight, and then took a second and larger gyration, always rising toward the sun, and enlarging their circle of flight so as to make a gradually ascending spiral. The young ones still and slowly followed, apparently flying better as they mounted; and they continued this sublime exercise, always rising till they became mere points in the air, and the young ones were lost, and afterwards their parents, to our aching sight.\" (See  Isaiah 40:31 .)", "There have been observed in Palestine four distinct species of eagles, (1) the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos); (2) the spotted eagle (Aquila naevia); (3) the common species, the imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca); and (4) the Circaetos gallicus, which preys on reptiles.

It was most general among the Egyptians, and it is in connection with this people that the two instances which we meet with in the Old Testament are mentioned. ( Genesis 50:2,26 ) The embalmers first removed part of the brain through the nostrils, by means of a crooked iron, and destroyed the rest by injecting caustic drugs. An incision was then made along the flank with a sharp Ethiopian stone, and the whole of the intestines removed. The cavity was rinsed out with palm wine, and afterwards scoured with pounded perfumes. It was then filled with pure myrrh pounded, cassia and other aromatics, except frankincense. This done, the body was sewn up and steeped in natron (salf-petre) for seventy days. When the seventy days were accomplished, the embalmers washed the corpse and swathed it in bandages of linen, cut in strips and smeared with gum. They then gave it up to the relatives of the deceased, who provided for it a wooden case, made in the shape of a man, in which the dead was placed,a nd deposited in an erect position against the wall of the sepulchral chamber. Sometimes no incision was made in the body, nor were the intestines removed, but cedar-oil was injected into the stomach by the rectum. At others the oil was prevented from escaping until the end of the steeping process, when it was withdrawn, and carried off with it the stomach and intestines in a state of solution, while the flesh was consumed by the natron, and nothing was left but the skin and bones. The body in this state was returned to the relatives of the deceased. The third mode, which was adopted by the poorer classes, and cost but little, consisted in rinsing out the intestines with syrm'a, an infusion of senna and cassia, and steeping the body for several days in natron. It does not appear that embalming was practiced by the Hebrews. The cost of embalming was sometimes nearly , varying from this amount down to or ."], "Word": "Embalming", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "7": {"Definitions": ["EMB'ALMING ,  participle present tense   Filling a dead body with spices for preservation; preserving with care from loss, decay or destruction."], "Word": "Embalming", "Dictionary": "Webster's 1828 Dictionary"}}}

The site must undoubtedly be sought for somewhere along the course of the great streams the Tigris and the Euphrates of Western Asia, in \"the land of Shinar\" or Babylonia. The region from about lat. 33 degrees 30' to lat. 31 degrees, which is a very rich and fertile tract, has been by the most competent authorities agreed on as the probable site of Eden. \"It is a region where streams abound, where they divide and re-unite, where alone in the Mesopotamian tract can be found the phenomenon of a single river parting into four arms, each of which is or has been a river of consequence.\"", "Among almost all nations there are traditions of the primitive innocence of our race in the garden of Eden. This was the \"golden age\" to which the Greeks looked back. Men then lived a \"life free from care, and without labour and sorrow.

Many scholars believe that it was in Southern Arabia, and recent excavations have shown that the valley of the Nile was originally inhabited by a low-class population, perhaps belonging to the Nigritian stock, before the Egyptians of history entered it. The ancient Egyptian language, of which the latest form is Coptic, is distantly connected with the Semitic family of speech.", "Egypt consists geographically of two halves, the northern being the Delta, and the southern Upper Egypt, between Cairo and the First Cataract. In the Old Testament, Northern or Lower Egypt is called Mazor, \"the fortified land\" ( Isaiah 19:6 ;  37:25 , where the A.V. mistranslates \"defence\" and \"besieged places\"); while Southern or Upper Egypt is Pathros, the Egyptian Pa-to-Res, or \"the land of the south\" ( Isaiah 11:11 ). But the whole country is generally mentioned under the dual name of Mizraim, \"the two Mazors.\"", "The civilization of Egypt goes back to a very remote antiquity. The two kingdoms of the north and south were united by Menes, the founder of the first historical dynasty of kings. The first six dynasties constitute what is known as the Old Empire, which had its capital at Memphis, south of Cairo, called in the Old Testament Moph ( Hosea 9:6 ) and Noph. The native name was Mennofer, \"the good place.\"", "The Pyramids were tombs of the monarchs of the Old Empire, those of Gizeh being erected in the time of the Fourth Dynasty. After the fall of the Old Empire came a period of decline and obscurity. This was followed by the Middle Empire, the most powerful dynasty of which was the Twelfth. The Fayyum was rescued for agriculture by the kings of the Twelfth Dynasty; and two obelisks were erected in front of the temple of the sun-god at On or Heliopolis (near Cairo), one of which is still standing. The capital of the Middle Empire was Thebes, in Upper Egypt.", "The Middle Empire was overthrown by the invasion of the Hyksos, or shepherd princes from Asia, who ruled over Egypt, more especially in the north, for several centuries, and of whom there were three dynasties of kings. They had their capital at Zoan or Tanis (now San), in the north-eastern part of the Delta. It was in the time of the Hyksos that Abraham, Jacob, and Joseph entered Egypt. The Hyksos were finally expelled about B.C. 1600, by the hereditary princes of Thebes, who founded the Eighteenth Dynasty, and carried the war into Asia. Canaan and Syria were subdued, as well as Cyprus, and the boundaries of the Egyptian Empire were fixed at the Euphrates. The Soudan, which had been conquered by the kings of the Twelfth Dynasty, was again annexed to Egypt, and the eldest son of the Pharaoh took the title of \"Prince of Cush.\"", "One of the later kings of the dynasty, Amenophis IV., or Khu-n-Aten, endeavoured to supplant the ancient state religion of Egypt by a new faith derived from Asia, which was a sort of pantheistic monotheism, the one supreme god being adored under the image of the solar disk. The attempt led to religious and civil war, and the Pharaoh retreated from Thebes to Central Egypt, where he built a new capital, on the site of the present Tell-el-Amarna. The cuneiform tablets that have been found there represent his foreign correspondence (about B.C. 1400). He surrounded himself with officials and courtiers of Asiatic, and more especially Canaanitish, extraction; but the native party succeeded eventually in overthrowing the government, the capital of Khu-n-Aten was destroyed, and the foreigners were driven out of the country, those that remained being reduced to serfdom.", "The national triumph was marked by the rise of the Nineteenth Dynasty, in the founder of which, Rameses I., we must see the \"new king, who knew not Joseph.\" His grandson, Rameses II., reigned sixty-seven years (B.C. 1348-1281), and was an indefatigable builder. As Pithom, excavated by Dr. Naville in 1883, was one of the cities he built, he must have been the Pharaoh of the Oppression. The Pharaoh of the Exodus may have been one of his immediate successors, whose reigns were short. Under them Egypt lost its empire in Asia, and was itself attacked by barbarians from Libya and the north.", "The Nineteenth Dynasty soon afterwards came to an end; Egypt was distracted by civil war; and for a short time a Canaanite, Arisu, ruled over it.", "Then came the Twentieth Dynasty, the second Pharaoh of which, Rameses III., restored the power of his country. In one of his campaigns he overran the southern part of Palestine, where the Israelites had not yet settled. They must at the time have been still in the wilderness. But it was during the reign of Rameses III. that Egypt finally lost Gaza and the adjoining cities, which were seized by the Pulista, or Philistines.", "After Rameses III., Egypt fell into decay. Solomon married the daughter of one of the last kings of the Twenty-first Dynasty, which was overthrown by Shishak I., the general of the Libyan mercenaries, who founded the Twenty-second Dynasty ( 1 Kings 11:40 ;  14:25, 26 ). A list of the places he captured in Palestine is engraved on the outside of the south wall of the temple of Karnak.", "In the time of Hezekiah, Egypt was conquered by Ethiopians from the Soudan, who constituted the Twenty-fifth Dynasty. The third of them was Tirhakah ( 2 Kings 19:9 ). In B.C. 674 it was conquered by the Assyrians, who divided it into twenty satrapies, and Tirhakah was driven back to his ancestral dominions. Fourteen years later it successfully revolted under Psammetichus I. of Sais, the founder of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty. Among his successors were Necho ( 2 Kings 23:29 ) and Hophra, or Apries ( Jeremiah 37:5, 7, 11 ). The dynasty came to an end in B.C. 525, when the country was subjugated by Cambyses. Soon afterwards it was organized into a Persian satrapy.", "The title of Pharaoh, given to the Egyptian kings, is the Egyptian Per-aa, or \"Great House,\" which may be compared to that of \"Sublime Porte.\" It is found in very early Egyptian texts.", "The Egyptian religion was a strange mixture of pantheism and animal worship, the gods being adored in the form of animals. While the educated classes resolved their manifold deities into manifestations of one omnipresent and omnipotent divine power, the lower classes regarded the animals as incarnations of the gods.", "Under the Old Empire, Ptah, the Creator, the god of Memphis, was at the head of the Pantheon; afterwards Amon, the god of Thebes, took his place. Amon, like most of the other gods, was identified with Ra, the sun-god of Heliopolis.", "The Egyptians believed in a resurrection and future life, as well as in a state of rewards and punishments dependent on our conduct in this world. The judge of the dead was Osiris, who had been slain by Set, the representative of evil, and afterwards restored to life. His death was avenged by his son Horus, whom the Egyptians invoked as their \"Redeemer.\" Osiris and Horus, along with Isis, formed a trinity, who were regarded as representing the sun-god under different forms.", "Even in the time of Abraham, Egypt was a flourishing and settled monarchy. Its oldest capital, within the historic period, was Memphis, the ruins of which may still be seen near the Pyramids and the Sphinx. When the Old Empire of Menes came to an end, the seat of empire was shifted to Thebes, some 300 miles farther up the Nile. A short time after that, the Delta was conquered by the Hyksos, or shepherd kings, who fixed their capital at Zoan, the Greek Tanis, now San, on the Tanic arm of the Nile. All this occurred before the time of the new king \"which knew not Joseph\" ( Exodus 1:8 ). In later times Egypt was conquered by the Persians (B.C. 525), and by the Greeks under Alexander the Great (B.C. 332), after whom the Ptolemies ruled the country for three centuries. Subsequently it was for a time a province of the Roman Empire; and at last, in A.D. 1517, it fell into the hands of the Turks, of whose empire it still forms nominally a part. Abraham and Sarah went to Egypt in the time of the shepherd kings. The exile of Joseph and the migration of Jacob to \"the land of Goshen\" occurred about 200 years later. On the death of Solomon, Shishak, king of Egypt, invaded Palestine ( 1 Kings 14:25 ). He left a list of the cities he conquered.", "A number of remarkable clay tablets, discovered at Tell-el-Amarna in Upper Egypt, are the most important historical records ever found in connection with the Bible. They most fully confirm the historical statements of the Book of Joshua, and prove the antiquity of civilization in Syria and Palestine. As the clay in different parts of Palestine differs, it has been found possible by the clay alone to decide where the tablets come from when the name of the writer is lost. The inscriptions are cuneiform, and in the Aramaic language, resembling Assyrian. The writers are Phoenicians, Amorites, and Philistines, but in no instance Hittites, though Hittites are mentioned. The tablets consist of official dispatches and letters, dating from B.C. 1480, addressed to the two Pharaohs, Amenophis III. and IV., the last of this dynasty, from the kings and governors of Phoenicia and Palestine. There occur the names of three kings killed by Joshua, Adoni-zedec, king of Jerusalem, Japhia, king of Lachish ( Joshua 10:3 ), and Jabin, king of Hazor ( 11:1 ); also the Hebrews (Abiri) are said to have come from the desert.", "The principal prophecies of Scripture regarding Egypt are these,  Isaiah 19 ;  Jeremiah 43:8-13 ;  44:30 ;  46 ;  Ezekiel 29-32 ; and it might be easily shown that they have all been remarkably fulfilled.

The climate is equable and healthy. Rain is not very unfrequent on the northern coast, but inland is very rare. Cultivation nowhere depends upon it. The inundation of the Nile fertilizes and sustains the country, and makes the river its chief blessing. The Nile was on this account anciently worshipped. The rise begins in Egypt about the summer solstice, and the inundation commences about two months later. The greatest height is attained about or somewhat after the autumnal equinox. The inundation lasts about three months.

It is said that the eagle sheds his feathers in the beginning of spring, and with fresh plumage assumes the appearance of youth. To this, allusion is made in  Psalms 103:5  and  Isaiah 40:31 . God's care over his people is likened to that of the eagle in training its young to fly ( Exodus 19:4 ;  Deuteronomy 32:11, 12 ). An interesting illustration is thus recorded by Sir Humphry Davy;, \"I once saw a very interesting sight above the crags of Ben Nevis. Two parent eagles were teaching their offspring, two young birds, the maneuvers of flight. They began by rising from the top of the mountain in the eye of the sun. It was about mid-day, and bright for the climate. They at first made small circles, and the young birds imitated them. They paused on their wings, waiting till they had made their flight, and then took a second and larger gyration, always rising toward the sun, and enlarging their circle of flight so as to make a gradually ascending spiral. The young ones still and slowly followed, apparently flying better as they mounted; and they continued this sublime exercise, always rising till they became mere points in the air, and the young ones were lost, and afterwards their parents, to our aching sight.\" (See  Isaiah 40:31 .)", "There have been observed in Palestine four distinct species of eagles, (1) the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos); (2) the spotted eagle (Aquila naevia); (3) the common species, the imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca); and (4) the Circaetos gallicus, which preys on reptiles.

The Hebrew  nesher  may stand for any of these different species, though perhaps more particular reference to the golden and imperial eagles and the  griffon vulture  may be intended. The passage in Micah, ( Micah 1:16 ) \"enlarge thy baldness as the eagle,\" may refer to the griffon vulture,  Vultur fulvus  , in which case the simile is peculiarly appropriate, for the whole head and neck of this bird are destitute of true feathers. The \"eagles\" of ( Matthew 24:28 ;  Luke 17:37 ) may include the  Vultur fulvus  and  Neophron percnopterus  ; though, as eagles frequently prey upon dead bodies, there is no necessity to restrict the Greek word to the  Vulturid'  .

Ezra assembled the band of exiles, probably about 5,000 in all, who were prepared to go up with him to Jerusalem, on the banks of the Ahava, where they rested for three days, and were put into order for their march across the desert, which was completed in four months.

It is significant that the earliest mention of the pulpit occurs in the history of Ezra's ministry ( Nehemiah 8:4 ). He was much more of a teacher than a priest. We learn from the account of his labours in the book of Nehemiah that he was careful to have the whole people instructed in the law of Moses; and there is no reason to reject the constant tradition of the Jews which connects his name with the collecting and editing of the Old Testament canon. The final completion of the canon may have been, and probably was, the work of a later generation; but Ezra seems to have put it much into the shape in which it is still found in the Hebrew Bible.

After the ruined wall of the city had been built by Nehemiah, there was a great gathering of the people at Jerusalem preparatory to the dedication of the wall. On the appointed day the whole population assembled, and the law was read aloud to them by Ezra and his assistants ( Nehemiah 8:3 ). The remarkable scene is described in detail. There was a great religious awakening. For successive days they held solemn assemblies, confessing their sins and offering up solemn sacrifices. They kept also the feast of Tabernacles with great solemnity and joyous enthusiasm, and then renewed their national covenant to be the Lord's.

The name of Edom, \"red\", was also given to him from his conduct in connection with the red lentil \"pottage\" for which he sold his birthright (30, 31). The circumstances connected with his birth foreshadowed the enmity which afterwards subsisted between the twin brothers and the nations they founded ( 25:22, 23, 26 ). In process of time Jacob, following his natural bent, became a shepherd; while Esau, a \"son of the desert,\" devoted himself to the perilous and toilsome life of a huntsman. On a certain occasion, on returning from the chase, urged by the cravings of hunger, Esau sold his birthright to his brother, Jacob, who thereby obtained the covenant blessing ( Genesis 27:28, 29, 36 ;  Hebrews 12:16, 17 ).

This led him to cast in his lot with the Ishmaelite tribes; and driving the Horites out of Mount Seir, he settled in that region. After some thirty years' sojourn in Padan-aram Jacob returned to Canaan, and was reconciled to Esau, who went forth to meet him ( 33:4 ). Twenty years after this, Isaac their father died, when the two brothers met, probably for the last time, beside his grave ( 35:29 ).
