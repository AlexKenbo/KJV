The Roman generals when they went to war, sometimes made a  vow  that they would build a temple to some favorite deity, if he would give them victory. A  vow  is a promise of something to be given or done hereafter.", "A person is constituted a religious by taking three vows, of chastity, of poverty, and of obedience. Among the Isrealites, the vows of children were not binding, unless ratified by the express or tacit consent of their father.  Numbers 30:2 .", "2.  A solemn promise; as the vows of unchangeable love and fidelity. In a moral and religious sense, vows are promises to God, as they appeal to God to witness their sincerity, and the violation of them is a most heinous offense.", "VOW ,  verb transitive", "1.  To give, consecrate or dedicate to God by a solemn promise. When Jacob went to Mesopotamia, he vowed to God a tenth of this substance, and his own future devotion to his service.  Genesis 28:20 .", "When thou vowest a  vow   defer not to pay it.  Ecclesiastes 5:4 .", "2.  To devote.", "VOW ,  verb intransitive   To make vows or solemn promises. He that vows, must be careful to perform."], "Word": "Vow", "Dictionary": "Webster's 1828 Dictionary"}}}
