If  wisdom  is to be considered as a faculty of the mind, it is the faculty of discerning or judging what is most just, proper and useful, and if it is to be considered as an acquirement, it is the knowledge and use of what is best, most just, most proper, most conducive to prosperity or happiness.  wisdom  in the first sense, or practical  wisdom  is nearly synonymous with discretion. It differs somewhat from prudence, in this respect; prudence is the exercise of sound judgment in avoiding evils;  wisdom  is the exercise of sound judgment either in avoiding evils or attempting good.

The first part contains the praise of wisdom as the source of immortality, in contrast with the teaching of sensualists; and next the praise of wisdom as the guide of practical and intellectual life, the stay of princes, and the interpreter of the universe. The second part, again, follows the action of wisdom summarily, as preserving God's servants, from Adam to Moses, and more particularly in the punishment of the Egyptians and Canaanites.  Style and language  .", "The literary character of the book is most remarkable and interesting. In the richness and freedom of its vocabulary it most closely resembles the Fourth Book of Maccabees, but it is superior to that fine declamation in both power and variety of diction. The magnificent description of wisdom ch. 7.22-8.1, must rank among the noblest passages of human eloquence, and it would be perhaps impossible to point out any piece of equal length in the remains of classical antiquity more pregnant with noble thought or more rich in expressive phraseology.  Doctrinal character.", "The theological teaching of the book offers, in many respects, the nearest approach to the language and doctrines of Greek philosophy that is found in any Jewish writing up to the time of Philo. There is much in the views which it gives of the world of man and of the divine nature which springs rather from the combination or conflict of Hebrew and Greek thought than from the independent development of Hebrew thought alone. The conception is presented of the body as a mere weight and clog to the soul. ch, 9.15; contrast ( 2 Corinthians 5:1-4 ) There is, on the other hand no trace of the characteristic Christian doctrine of a resurrection of the body. The identification of the tempter, ( Genesis 3:1 ) ... directly or indirectly with the devil, as the bringer \"of death into the world\" ch. 2.23, 24, is the most remarkable development of biblical doctrine which the book contains. Generally, too, it may be observed that, as in the cognate books, Proverbs and Ecclesiastes, there are few traces of the recognition of the sinfulness even of the wise man in his wisdom, which forms in the Psalms and the prophets, the basis of the Christian doctrine of the atonement- yet comp. ( Genesis 15:2 ) In connection with the Old Testament Scriptures, the book, as a whole, may be regarded as carrying on one step farther the great problem of life contained in Ecclesiastes and Job.  Date.", "From internal evidence it seems most reasonable to believe that the work was composed in Greek at Alexandria some time before the time of Philo-about 120-80 B.C. It seems impossible to study this book dispassionately and not feel that it forms one of the last links in the chain of providential connection between the Old and New Covenants. It would not be easy to find elsewhere any pre-Christian view of religion equally wide, sustained and definite."], "Word": "Wisdom, The, of Solomon", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}}}

The natural history and culture of the vine are described under a separate head. [ VINE ] The only other plant whose fruit is noticed as having been converted into wine was the pomegranate. ( Solomon 8:2 ) In Palestine the vintage takes place in September, and is celebrated with great rejoicing. The ripe fruit was gathered in baskets, ( Jeremiah 6:9 ) as represented in Egyptian paintings, and was carried to the wine-press. It was then placed in the upper one of the two vats or receptacles of which the winepress was formed, and was subjected to the process of \"treading,\" which has prevailed in all ages in Oriental and south European countries. ( Nehemiah 13:15 ;  Job 24:11 ;  Isaiah 18:10 ;  Jeremiah 25:30 ;  48:33 ;  Amos 9:13 ;  Revelation 19:15 ) A certain amount of juice exuded front the ripe fruit from its own pressure before treading commenced. This appears to have been kept separate from the rest of the juice, and to have formed the \"sweet wine\" noticed in ( Acts 2:13 ) [below] The \"treading\" was effected by one or more men, according to the size of the vat. They encouraged one another by shouts. ( Isaiah 16:9,10 ;  Jeremiah 25:30 ;  48:33 ) Their legs and garments were dyed red with the juice. ( Genesis 40:11 ;  Isaiah 63:2,3 ) The expressed juice escaped by an aperture into the lower vat, or was at once collected in vessels. A hand-press was occasionally used in Egypt, but we have no notice of such an instrument in the Bible. As to the subsequent treatment of the wine we have but little information. Sometimes it was preserved in its unfermented state and drunk as must, but more generally it was bottled off after fermentation and if it were designed to be kept for some time a certain amount of lees was added to give it body. ( Isaiah 25:6 ) The wine consequently required to be \"refined\" or strained previous to being brought to table. ( Isaiah 25:6 ) To wine, is attributed the \"darkly-flashing eye,\" ( Genesis 40:12 ) Authorized Version \"red,\" the unbridled tongue, ( Proverbs 20:1 ;  Isaiah 28:7 ) the excitement of the spirit, ( Proverbs 31:6 ;  Isaiah 5:11 ;  Zechariah 9:15 ;  10:7 ) the enchained affections of its votaries, ( Hosea 4:11 ) the perverted judgment, ( Proverbs 31:5 ;  Isaiah 28:7 ) the indecent exposure, ( Habakkuk 2:15,16 ) and the sickness resulting from the heat ( chemah  , Authorized Version \"bottles\") of wine. ( Hosea 7:5 ) The allusions to the effects of  tirosh  are confined to a single passage, but this a most decisive one, viz. ( Hosea 4:11 ) \"Whoredom and wine ( yayin ) and new wine ( tirosh ) take away the heart,\" where  tirosh  appears as the climax of engrossing influences, in immediate connection with  yayin  . It has been disputed whether the Hebrew wine was fermented; but the impression produced on the mind by a general review of the above notices is that the Hebrew words indicating wine refer to fermented, intoxicating wine. The notices of fermentation are not very decisive. A certain amount of fermentation is implied in the distension of the leather bottles when new wine was placed in them, and which was liable to burst old bottles. It is very likely that new wine was preserved in the state of must by placing it in jars or bottles and then burying it in the earth. The mingling that we read of in conjunction with wine may have been designed either to increase or to diminish the strength of the wine, according as spices or water formed the ingredient that was added. The notices chiefly favor the former view; for mingled liquor was prepared for high festivals, ( Proverbs 9:2,5 ) and occasions of excess. ( Proverbs 23:30 ;  Isaiah 5:22 ) At the same time strength was not the sole object sought; the wine \"mingled with myrrh,\" given to Jesus, was designed to deaden pain, ( Mark 15:23 ) and the spiced pomegranate wine prepared by the bride, ( Solomon 8:2 ) may well have been of a mild character. In the New Testament the character of the \"sweet wine,\" noticed in ( Acts 2:13 ) calls for some little remark. It could not be new wine in the proper sense of the term, inasmuch as about eight months must have elapsed between the vintage and the feast of Pentecost. The explanations of the ancient lexicographers rather lead us to infer that its luscious qualities were due, not to its being recently made, but to its being produced from the very purest juice of the grape. There can be little doubt that the wines of palestine varied in quality, and were named after the localities in which they were made. The only wines of which we have special notice belonged to Syria these were the wine of Helbon ( Ezekiel 27:18 ) and the wine of Lebanon, famed for its aroma. ( Hosea 14:7 ) With regard to the uses of wine in private life there is little to remark. It was produced on occasions of ordinary hospitality, ( Genesis 14:18 ) and at festivals, such as marriages. ( John 2:3 ) Under the Mosaic law wine formed the usual drink offering that accompanied the daily sacrifice, ( Exodus 29:40 ) the presentation of the first-fruits, ( Leviticus 23:13 ) and other offerings. ( Numbers 15:5 ) Tithe was to be paid of wine, as of other products. The priest was also to receive first-fruits of wine, as of other articles. ( 18:4 ) comp. ( Exodus 22:29 ) The use of wine at the paschal feast was not enjoined by the law, but had become an established custom, at all events in the post-Babylonian period. The wine was mixed with warm water on these occasions. Hence in the early Christian Church it was usual to mix the sacramental wine with water. (The simple wines of antiquity were incomparably less deadly than the stupefying and ardent beverages of our western nations.

We learn from it that they believed in the existence of one Supreme Being, the immortality of the soul, judgement after death, and the resurrection of the body.

That the Egyptians in the time of Joseph were acquainted with writing of a certain kind there is evidence to prove, but there is nothing to show that up to this period the knowledge extended to the Hebrew family. At the same time there is no evidence against it. Writing is first distinctly mentioned in ( Exodus 17:14 ) and the connection clearly implies that it was not then employed for the first time but was so familiar as to be used for historic records. It is not absolutely necessary to infer from this that the art of writing was an accomplishment possessed by every Hebrew citizen. If we examine the instances in which writing is mentioned in connection with individuals, we shall find that in all cases the writers were men of superior position. In ( Isaiah 29:11,12 ) there is clearly a distinction drawn between the man who was able to read and the man who was not, and it seems a natural inference that the accomplishments of reading and writing were not widely spread among the people, when we find that they are universally attributed to those of high rank or education-kings, priests, prophets and professional scribes. In the name Kirjathsepher ( book-town ), ( Joshua 15:15 ) there is an indication of a knowledge of writing among the Phoenicians. The Hebrews, then, a branch of the great Semitic family, being in possession of the art of writing, according to their own historical records, at a very early period, the further questions arise, what character they made use of, and whence they obtained it. Recent investigations have shown that the square Hebrew character is of comparatively modern date, and has been formed from a more ancient type by a gradual process of development. What then was this ancient type? Most probably the Phoenician. Pliny was of opinion that letters were of Assyrian origin. Dioderus Siculus (v. 74) says that the Syrians invented letters, and from them the Phoenicians, having learned them transferred them to the Greeks. According to Tacitus (Ann. xi. 14,, Egypt was believed to be the source whence the Phoenicians got their knowledge. Be this as it may, to the Phoenicians, the daring seamen and adventurous colonizers of the ancient world the voice of tradition has assigned the honor of the invention of letters. Whether it came to them from an Aramean or an Egyptian source can at best he but the subject of conjecture. It may, however, be reasonably inferred that the ancient Hebrews derived from or shared with the Phoenicians the knowledge of writing and the use of letters. The names of the Hebrew letters indicate that they must have been the invention of a Shemitic people, and that they were moreover a pastoral people may be inferred from the same evidence. But whether or not the Phoenicians were the inventors of the Shemitic alphabet, there can be no doubt of their just claim to being its chief disseminators; and with this understanding we may accept the genealogy of alphabets as given by Gesenius, and exhibited in the accompanying table. The old Semitic alphabets may he divided into two principal classes-"], "Word": "Writing", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "4": {"Definitions": ["WRITING ,  participle present tense", "1.

A contest between nations or states, carried on by force, either for defense, or for revenging insults and redressing wrongs, for the extension of commerce or acquisition of territory, or for obtaining and establishing the superiority and dominion of one over the other. These objects are accomplished by the slaughter or capture of troops, and the capture and destruction of ships, towns and property. Among rude nations,  war  is often waged and carried on for plunder. As  war  is the contest of nations or states, it always implies that such contest is authorized by the monarch or the sovereign power of the nation. When  war  is commenced by attacking a nation in peace, it si called an offensive  war   and such attack is aggressive. When  war  is undertaken to repel invasion or the attacks of an enemy, it is called defensive, and a defensive  war  is considered as justifiable. Very few of the wars that have desolated nations and deluged the earth with blood, have been justifiable. Happy would it be for mankind, if the prevalence of Christian principles might ultimately extinguish the spirit of  war   and if the ambition to be great, might yield to the ambition of being good.", "Preparation for  war  is sometimes the best security for peace.", "2.

The northwest wind prevails from the autumnal equinox to the beginning of November, and the north wind from June to the equinox. The east wind crosses the sandy wastes of Arabia Deserts before reaching Palestine and was hence termed \"the wind of the wilderness.\" ( Job 1:19 ;  Jeremiah 13:14 ) It blows with violence, and is hence supposed to be used generally for any violent wind.
