These pools derive their chief supply of water from a spring called \"the sealed fountain,\" about 200 yards to the north-west of the upper pool, to which it is conveyed by a large subterranean passage. They are 150 feet distant from each other, and each pool is 20 feet lower than that above it, the conduits being so arranged that the lowest, which is the largest and finest of the three, is filled first, and then in succession the others. It has been estimated that these pools cover in all a space of about 7 acres, and are capable of containing three million gallons of water. They were, as is generally supposed, constructed in the days of Solomon. They are probably referred to in  Ecclesiastes 2:6 . On the fourth day after his victory over the Ammonites, etc., in the wilderness of Tekoa, Jehoshaphat assembled his army in the valley of Berachah (\"blessing\"), and there blessed the Lord. Berachah has been identified with the modern Bereikut, some 5 miles south of Wady Urtas, and hence the \"valley of Berachah\" may be this valley of pools, for the word means both \"blessing\" and \"pools;\" and it has been supposed, therefore, that this victory was celebrated beside Solomon's pools ( 2 Chronicles 20:26 ).", "These pools were primarily designed to supply Jerusalem with water. From the lower pool an aqueduct has been traced conveying the water through Bethlehem and across the valley of Gihon, and along the west slope of the Tyropoeon valley, till it finds its way into the great cisterns underneath the temple hill. The water, however, from the pools reaches now only to Bethlehem. The aqueduct beyond this has been destroyed."], "Word": "Pools of Solomon", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}}}

An unlawful  promise  is not binding, because it is void; for it is incompatible with a prior paramount obligation of obedience to the laws. An express  promise   is one expressed in words or writing. An implied  promise   is one which reason and justice dictate.

It is the name given to the temple fortress ( Nehemiah 2:8 ) and to the temple itself ( 1 Chronicles 29:1 ). It denotes also a spacious building or a great house ( Daniel 1:4 ;  4:4, 29:   Esther 1:5 ;  7:7 ), and a fortified place or an enclosure ( Ezekiel 25:4 ). Solomon's palace is described in  1 Kings 7:1-12  as a series of buildings rather than a single great structure. Thirteen years were spent in their erection. This palace stood on the eastern hill, adjoining the temple on the south.", "In the New Testament it designates the official residence of Pilate or that of the high priest ( Matthew 26:3, 58, 69 ;  Mark 14:54, 66 ;  John 18:15 ). In  Philippians 1:13  this word is the rendering of the Greek praitorion, meaning the praetorian cohorts at Rome (the life-guard of the Caesars). Paul was continually chained to a soldier of that corps ( Acts 28:16 ), and hence his name and sufferings became known in all the praetorium. The \"soldiers that kept\" him would, on relieving one another on guard, naturally spread the tidings regarding him among their comrades. Some, however, regard the praetroium (q.v.) as the barrack within the palace (the palatium) of the Caesars in Rome where a detachment of these praetorian guards was stationed, or as the camp of the guards placed outside the eastern walls of Rome.", "\"In the chambers which were occupied as guard-rooms,\" says Dr. Manning, \"by the praetorian troops on duty in the palace, a number of rude caricatures are found roughly scratched upon the walls, just such as may be seen upon barrack walls in every part of the world. Amongst these is one of a human figure nailed upon a cross. To add to the offence of the cross,' the crucified one is represented with the head of an animal, probably that of an ass. Before it stands the figure of a Roman legionary with one hand upraised in the attitude of worship. Underneath is the rude, misspelt, ungrammatical inscription, Alexamenos worships his god.

( 1 Chronicles 29:1 ;  Ezra 4:14 ;  Amos 4:3 ) etc. It often designates the royal residence, and usually suggests a fortress or battlemented house. The word occasionally included the whole city as in ( Esther 9:12 ) and again, as in ( 1 Kings 16:18 ) it is restricted to a part of the royal apartments. It is applied, as in ( 1 Chronicles 29:1 ) to the temple in Jerusalem. The site of the palace of Solomon was almost certainly in the city itself on the brow opposite to the temple, and overlooking it and the whole city of David. It is impossible, of course, to be at all certain what was either the form or the exact disposition of such a palace; but, as we have the dimensions of the three principal buildings given in the book of Kings and confirmed by Josephus, we may, by taking these as a scale, ascertain pretty nearly that the building covered somewhere about 150,000 or 160,000 square feet. Whether it was a square of 400 feet each way, or an oblong of about 550 feet by 300, must always be more or less a matter of conjecture. The principal building situated within the palace was, as in all eastern palaces, the great hall of state and audience, called \"the house of the forest of Lebanon,\" apparently from the four rows of cedar pillars by which it was supported. It was 100 cubits (175 feet) long, 50 (88 feet) wide, and 30 (52 feet) high. Next in importance was the hall or \"porch of judgment,\" a quadrangular building supported by columns, as we learn front Josephus, which apparently stood on the other side of the great court, opposite the house of the forest of Lebanon. The third edifice is merely called a \"porch of pillars.\" Its dimensions were 50 by 30 cubits. Its use cannot be considered as doubtful, as it was an indispensable adjunct to an eastern palace. It was the ordinary place of business of the palace, and the reception-room when the king received ordinary visitors, and sat, except on great state occasions, to transact the business of the kingdom. Behind this, we are told, was the inner court, adorned with gardens and fountains, and surrounded by cloisters for shade; and there were other courts for the residence of the attendants and guards, and for the women of the harem. Apart from this palace, but attached, as Josephus tells us, to the hall of judgment, was the palace of Pharaoh's daughter-too proud and important a personage to be grouped with the ladies of the harem, and requiring a residence of her own. The recent discoveries at Nineveh have enabled us to understand many of the architectural details of this palace, which before they were made were nearly wholly inexplicable.

In the Authorized Version there are many different words so rendered, presenting different ideas, such as that of citadel or lofty fortress or royal residence ( Nehemiah 1:1 ;  Daniel 8:2 ). It is the name given to the temple fortress ( Nehemiah 2:8 ) and to the temple itself ( 1 Chronicles 29:1 ). It denotes also a spacious building or a great house ( Daniel 1:4 ;  4:4, 29:   Esther 1:5 ;  7:7 ), and a fortified place or an enclosure ( Ezekiel 25:4 ). Solomon's palace is described in  1 Kings 7:1-12  as a series of buildings rather than a single great structure. Thirteen years were spent in their erection. This palace stood on the eastern hill, adjoining the temple on the south.", "In the New Testament it designates the official residence of Pilate or that of the high priest ( Matthew 26:3, 58, 69 ;  Mark 14:54, 66 ;  John 18:15 ). In  Philippians 1:13  this word is the rendering of the Greek praitorion, meaning the praetorian cohorts at Rome (the life-guard of the Caesars). Paul was continually chained to a soldier of that corps ( Acts 28:16 ), and hence his name and sufferings became known in all the praetorium. The \"soldiers that kept\" him would, on relieving one another on guard, naturally spread the tidings regarding him among their comrades. Some, however, regard the praetroium (q.v.) as the barrack within the palace (the palatium) of the Caesars in Rome where a detachment of these praetorian guards was stationed, or as the camp of the guards placed outside the eastern walls of Rome.", "\"In the chambers which were occupied as guard-rooms,\" says Dr. Manning, \"by the praetorian troops on duty in the palace, a number of rude caricatures are found roughly scratched upon the walls, just such as may be seen upon barrack walls in every part of the world. Amongst these is one of a human figure nailed upon a cross. To add to the offence of the cross,' the crucified one is represented with the head of an animal, probably that of an ass. Before it stands the figure of a Roman legionary with one hand upraised in the attitude of worship. Underneath is the rude, misspelt, ungrammatical inscription, Alexamenos worships his god. It can scarcely be doubted that we have here a contemporary caricature, executed by one of the praetorian guard, ridiculing the faith of a Christian comrade.\""], "Word": "Palace", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "2": {"Definitions": ["For kings 1 Kings 21:1 ;  2 Kings 15:25 ;  Jeremiah 49:27 ;  Amos 1:12 ;  Nahum 2:6", "Of David 2 Samuel 7:2", "Of Solomon 1 Kings 7:1-12", "At Babylon Daniel 4:29 ;  Daniel 5:5 ;  Daniel 6:18", "At Shushan Nehemiah 1:1 ;  Esther 1:2 ;  Esther 7:7 ;  Daniel 8:2", "Archives kept in Ezra 6:2", "Proclamations issued from Amos 3:9", "Figurative, of a government Amos 1:12 ;  Amos 2:2 ;  Nahum 2:6"], "Word": "Palace", "Dictionary": "Naves Topical Index"}, "3": {"Definitions": ["Palace in the Bible, in the singular and plural, is the rendering of several words of diverse meaning. ( 1 Chronicles 29:1 ;  Ezra 4:14 ;  Amos 4:3 ) etc. It often designates the royal residence, and usually suggests a fortress or battlemented house. The word occasionally included the whole city as in ( Esther 9:12 ) and again, as in ( 1 Kings 16:18 ) it is restricted to a part of the royal apartments. It is applied, as in ( 1 Chronicles 29:1 ) to the temple in Jerusalem. The site of the palace of Solomon was almost certainly in the city itself on the brow opposite to the temple, and overlooking it and the whole city of David. It is impossible, of course, to be at all certain what was either the form or the exact disposition of such a palace; but, as we have the dimensions of the three principal buildings given in the book of Kings and confirmed by Josephus, we may, by taking these as a scale, ascertain pretty nearly that the building covered somewhere about 150,000 or 160,000 square feet. Whether it was a square of 400 feet each way, or an oblong of about 550 feet by 300, must always be more or less a matter of conjecture. The principal building situated within the palace was, as in all eastern palaces, the great hall of state and audience, called \"the house of the forest of Lebanon,\" apparently from the four rows of cedar pillars by which it was supported. It was 100 cubits (175 feet) long, 50 (88 feet) wide, and 30 (52 feet) high. Next in importance was the hall or \"porch of judgment,\" a quadrangular building supported by columns, as we learn front Josephus, which apparently stood on the other side of the great court, opposite the house of the forest of Lebanon. The third edifice is merely called a \"porch of pillars.\" Its dimensions were 50 by 30 cubits. Its use cannot be considered as doubtful, as it was an indispensable adjunct to an eastern palace. It was the ordinary place of business of the palace, and the reception-room when the king received ordinary visitors, and sat, except on great state occasions, to transact the business of the kingdom. Behind this, we are told, was the inner court, adorned with gardens and fountains, and surrounded by cloisters for shade; and there were other courts for the residence of the attendants and guards, and for the women of the harem. Apart from this palace, but attached, as Josephus tells us, to the hall of judgment, was the palace of Pharaoh's daughter-too proud and important a personage to be grouped with the ladies of the harem, and requiring a residence of her own. The recent discoveries at Nineveh have enabled us to understand many of the architectural details of this palace, which before they were made were nearly wholly inexplicable. Solomon constructed an ascent from his own house to the temple, \"the house of Jehovah,\" ( 1 Kings 10:5 ) which was a subterranean passage 250 feet long by 42 feet wide, of which the remains may still be traced."], "Word": "Palace", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "4": {"Definitions": ["PAL'ACE ,  noun   [Latin  palatium.]", "1.

It was kept in remembrance of the Lord's passing over the houses of the Israelites ( Exodus 12:13 ) when the first born of all the Egyptians were destroyed. It is called also the \"feast of unleavened bread\" ( Exodus 23:15 ;  Mark 14:1 ;  Acts 12:3 ), because during its celebration no leavened bread was to be eaten or even kept in the household ( Exodus 12:15 ). The word afterwards came to denote the lamb that was slain at the feast ( Mark 14:1 2-14;  1 Corinthians 5:7 ).", "A detailed account of the institution of this feast is given in Exodus 12 and 13. It was afterwards incorporated in the ceremonial law ( Leviticus 23:4-8)  as one of the great festivals of the nation. In after times many changes seem to have taken place as to the mode of its celebration as compared with its first celebration (comp.  Deuteronomy 16:2, 5, 6 ;  2 Chronicles 30:16 ;  Leviticus 23:10-14 ;  Numbers 9:10, 11 ;  28:16-24 ). Again, the use of wine ( Luke 22:17, 20 ), of sauce with the bitter herbs ( John 13:26 ), and the service of praise were introduced.", "There is recorded only one celebration of this feast between the Exodus and the entrance into Canaan, namely, that mentioned in  Numbers 9:5 . (See  JOSIAH .) It was primarily a commemorative ordinance, reminding the children of Israel of their deliverance out of Egypt; but it was, no doubt, also a type of the great deliverance wrought by the Messiah for all his people from the doom of death on account of sin, and from the bondage of sin itself, a worse than Egyptian bondage ( 1 Corinthians 5:7 ;  John 1:29 ;  19:32-36 ;  1 Peter 1:19 ;  Galatians 4:4, 5 ). The appearance of Jerusalem on the occasion of the Passover in the time of our Lord is thus fittingly described- \"The city itself and the neighbourhood became more and more crowded as the feast approached, the narrow streets and dark arched bazaars showing the same throng of men of all nations as when Jesus had first visited Jerusalem as a boy. Even the temple offered a strange sight at this season, for in parts of the outer courts a wide space was covered with pens for sheep, goats, and cattle to be used for offerings.

(Strictly speaking the Passover only applied to the paschal supper and the feast of unleavened bread followed, which was celebrated to the 21st.) (For the corresponding dates in our month, see  Jewish calendar  at the end of this volume.) The following are the principal passages in the Pentateuch relating to the Passover: ( Exodus 12:1-51 ;  13:3-10 ;  23:14-19 ;  34:18-26 ;  Leviticus 23:4-14 ;  Numbers 9:1-14 ;  28:16-25 ;  16:1-6 )  Why instituted  .", "This feast was instituted by God to commemorate the deliverance of the Isr'lites from Egyptian bondage and the sparing of their firstborn when the destroying angel smote the first-born of the Egyptians. The deliverance from Egypt was regarded as the starting-point of the Hebrew nation. The Isr'lites were then raised from the condition of bondmen under a foreign tyrant to that of a free people owing allegiance to no one but Jehovah. The prophet in a later age spoke of the event as  a creation  and  a redemption  of the nation. God declares himself to be \"the Creator of Isr'l.\" The Exodus was thus looked upon as the birth of the nation; the Passover was its annual birthday feast. It was the yearly memorial of the dedication of the people to him who had saved their first-born from the destroyer, in order that they might be made holy to himself.  First celebration of the Passover  .", "On the tenth day of the month, the head of each family was to select from the flock either a lamb or a kid, a male of the first year, without blemish. If his family was too small to eat the whole of the lamb, he was permitted to invite his nearest neighbor to join the party. On the fourteenth day of the month he was to kill his lamb, while the sun was setting. He was then to take blood in a basin and with a sprig of hyssop to sprinkle it on the two side-posts and the lintel of the door of the house. The lamb was then thoroughly roasted, whole. It was expressly forbidden that it should be boiled, or that a bone of it should be broken. Unleavened bread and bitter herbs were to be eaten with the flesh. No male who was uncircumcised was to join the company. Each one was to have his loins girt, to hold a staff in his hand, and to have shoes on his feet. He was to eat in haste, and it would seem that he was to stand during the meal. The number of the party was to be calculated as nearly as possible, so that all the flesh of the lamb might be eaten; but if any portion of it happened to remain, it was to be burned in the morning. No morsel of it was to be carried out of the house. The lambs were selected, on the fourteenth they were slain and the blood sprinkled, and in the following evening, after the fifteenth day of the had commenced the first paschal meal was eaten. At midnight the firstborn of the Egyptians were smitten. The king and his people were now urgent that the Isr'lites should start immediately, and readily bestowed on them supplies for the journey. In such haste did the Isr'lites depart, on that very day, ( Numbers 33:3 ) that they packed up their kneading troughs containing the dough prepared for the morrow's provisions, which was not yet leavened.  Observance of the Passover in later times  .", "As the original institution of the Passover in Egypt preceded the establishment of the priesthood and the regulation of the service of the tabernacle. It necessarily fell short in several particulars of the observance of the festival according to the fully-developed ceremonial law. The head of the family slew the lamb in his own house, not in the holy place; the blood was sprinkled on the doorway, not on the altar. But when the law was perfected, certain particulars were altered in order to assimilate the Passover to the accustomed order of religious service. In the twelfth and thirteenth chapters of Exodus there are not only distinct references to the observance of the festival in future ages (e.g.) ( Exodus 12:2,14,17,24-27,42 ;  13:2,5,8-10 ) but there are several injunctions which were evidently not intended for the first Passover, and which indeed could not possibly have been observed. Besides the private family festival, there were public and national sacrifices offered each of the seven days of unleavened bread. ( Numbers 28:19 ) On the second day also the first-fruits of the barley harvest were offered in the temple. ( Leviticus 23:10 ) In the latter notices of the festival in the books of the law there are particulars added which appear as modifications of the original institution. ( Leviticus 23:10-14 ;  Numbers 28:16-25 ;  16:1-6 ) Hence it is not without reason that the Jewish writers have laid great stress on the distinction between \"the Egyptian Passover\" and \"the perpetual Passover.\"  Mode and order of the paschal meal  .", "All work except that belonging to a few trades connected with daily life was suspended for some hours before the evening of the 14th Nisan. It was not lawful to eat any ordinary food after midday. No male was admitted to the table unless he was circumcised, even if he were of the seed of Isr'l. ( Exodus 12:48 ) It was customary for the number of a party to be not less than ten. When the meal was prepared, the family was placed round the table, the paterfamilias taking a place of honor, probably somewhat raised above the rest. When the party was arranged the first cup of wine was filled, and a blessing was asked by the head of the family on the feast, as well as a special, one on the cup. The bitter herbs were then placed on the table, and a portion of them eaten, either with Or without the sauce. The unleavened bread was handed round next and afterward the lamb was placed on the table in front of the head of the family. The paschal lamb could be legally slain and the blood and fat offered only in the national sanctuary. ( 16:2 ) Before the lamb was eaten the second cup of wine was filled, and the son, in accordance with ( Exodus 12:26 ) asked his father the meaning of the feast. In reply, an account was given of the sufferings of the Isr'lites in Egypt and of their deliverance, with a particular explanation of ( 26:5 ) and the first part of the Hallel (a contraction from  Hallelujah ), Psalms 113, 114, was sung. This being gone through, the lamb was carved and eaten. The third cup of wine was poured out and drunk, and soon afterward the fourth. The second part of the Hallel, Psalms 115 to 118 was then sung. A fifth wine-cup appears to have been occasionally produced, But perhaps only in later times. What was termed the greater Hallel, Psalms 120 to 138 was sung on such occasions. The Isr'lites who lived in the country appear to have been accommodated at the feast by the inhabitants of Jerusalem in their houses, so far its there was room for them. ( Matthew 26:18 ;  Luke 22:10-12 ) Those who could not be received into the city encamped without the walls in tents as the pilgrims now do at Mecca.  The Passover as a type  .", "The Passover was not only commemorative but also typical. \"The deliverance which it commemorated was a type of the great salvation it foretold.\"", "No other shadow of things to come contained in the law can vie with the festival of the Passover in expressiveness and completeness. (1) The paschal lamb must of course be regarded as the leading feature in the ceremonial of the festival. The lamb slain typified Christ the \"Lamb of God.\" slain for the sins of the world. Christ \"our Passover is sacrificed for us.\" ( 1 Corinthians 5:7 ) According to the divine purpose, the true Lamb of God was slain at nearly the same time as \"the Lord's Passover\" at the same season of the year; and at the same time of the day as the daily sacrifice at the temple, the crucifixion beginning at the hour of the morning sacrifice and ending at the hour of the evening sacrifice. That the lamb was to be roasted and not boiled has been supposed to commemorate the haste of the departure of the Isr'lites. It is not difficult to determine the reason of the command \"not a bone of him shall be broken.\" The lamb was to be a symbol of unity", "the unity of the family, the unity of the nation, the unity of God with his people whom he had taken into covenant with himself. (2) The unleavened bread ranks next in importance to the paschal lamb. We are warranted in concluding that unleavened bread had a peculiar sacrificial character, according to the law. It seems more reasonable to accept St, Paul's reference to the subject, ( 1 Corinthians 5:6-8 ) as furnishing the true meaning of the symbol. Fermentation is decomposition, a dissolution of unity. The pure dry biscuit would be an apt emblem of unchanged duration, and, in its freedom from foreign mixture, of purity also. (3) The offering of the omer or first sheaf of the harvest, ( Leviticus 23:10-14 ) signified deliverance from winter the bondage of Egypt being well considered as a winter in the history of the nation. (4) The consecration of the first-fruits, the firstborn of the soil, is an easy type of the consecration of the first born of the Isr'lites, and of our own best selves, to God. Further than this (1) the Passover is a type of deliverance from the slavery of sin. (2) It is the passing over of the doom we deserve for your sins, because the blood of Christ has been applied to us by faith. (3) The sprinkling of the blood upon the door-posts was a symbol of open confession of our allegiance and love. (4) The Passover was useless unless eaten; so we live upon the Lord Jesus Christ. (5) It was eaten with bitter herbs, as we must eat our passover with the bitter herbs of repentance and confession, which yet, like the bitter herbs of the Passover, are a fitting and natural accompaniment. (6) As the Isr'lites ate the Passover all prepared for the journey, so do we with a readiness and desire to enter the active service of Christ, and to go on the journey toward heaven.", "ED.)"], "Word": "Passover", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "39": {"Definitions": ["P'ASSOVER ,  noun   [pass and over.] A feast of the Jews, instituted to commemorate the providential escape of the Hebrews, in Egypt, when God smiting the first-born of the Egyptians, passed over the houses of the Israelites, which were marked with the blood of the paschal lamb.", "1.

The appearance of Jerusalem on the occasion of the Passover in the time of our Lord is thus fittingly described- \"The city itself and the neighbourhood became more and more crowded as the feast approached, the narrow streets and dark arched bazaars showing the same throng of men of all nations as when Jesus had first visited Jerusalem as a boy. Even the temple offered a strange sight at this season, for in parts of the outer courts a wide space was covered with pens for sheep, goats, and cattle to be used for offerings. Sellers shouted the merits of their beasts, sheep bleated, oxen lowed. Sellers of doves also had a place set apart for them. Potters offered a choice from huge stacks of clay dishes and ovens for roasting and eating the Passover lamb. Booths for wine, oil, salt, and all else needed for sacrifices invited customers. Persons going to and from the city shortened their journey by crossing the temple grounds, often carrying burdens...Stalls to change foreign money into the shekel of the temple, which alone could be paid to the priests, were numerous, the whole confusion making the sanctuary like a noisy market\" (Geikie's Life of Christ)."], "Word": "Passover", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "37": {"Definitions": ["Institution of Exodus 12:3-49 ;  Exodus 23:15-18 ;  Exodus 34:18 ;  Leviticus 23:4-8 ;  Numbers 9:2-5 ;  Numbers 9:13-14 ;  Numbers 28:16-25 ;  Deuteronomy 16:1-8 ;  Deuteronomy 16:16 ;  Psalms 81:3 ;  Psalms 81:5", "Design of Exodus 12:21-28", "Special Passover, for those who were unclean, or on journey, to be held in second month Numbers 9:6-12 ;  2 Chronicles 30:2-4", "Lamb killed by Levites, for those who were ceremonially unclean 2 Chronicles 30:17 ;  2 Chronicles 35:3-11 ;  Ezra 6:20", "Strangers authorized to celebrate Exodus 12:48-49 ;  Numbers 9:14", "Observed:", "At place designated by God Deuteronomy 16:5-7", "With unleavened bread Exodus 12:8 ;  Exodus 12:15-20 ;  Exodus 13:3 ;  Exodus 13:6 ;  Exodus 23:15 ;  Leviticus 23:6 ;  Numbers 9:11 ;  Numbers 28:17 ;  Deuteronomy 16:3-4 ;  Mark 14:12 ;  Luke 22:7 ;  Acts 12:3 ;  1 Corinthians 5:8", "Penalty for neglecting to observe Numbers 9:13", "Reinstituted by Ezekiel Ezekiel 45:21-24", "Observation of:", "Renewed by the Israelites on entering Canaan Joshua 5:10-11", "By Hezekiah 2 Chronicles 30:1", "By Josiah 2 Kings 23:22-23 ;  2 Chronicles 35:1 ;  2 Chronicles 35:18", "After return from captivity Ezra 6:19-20", "By Jesus Matthew 26:17-20 ;  Luke 22:15 ;  John 2:13 ;  John 2:23 ;  John 43:13", "Jesus in the temple at time of Luke 2:41-50", "Jesus crucified at time of Matthew 26:2 ;  Mark 14:1-2 ;  John 18:28", "The lamb of, a type of Christ 1 Corinthians 5:7", "Lord's supper ordained at Matthew 26:26-28 ;  Mark 14:12-25 ;  Luke 22:7-20", "Prisoner released at, by the Romans Matthew 27:15 ;  Mark 15:6 ;  Luke 23:16-17 ;  John 18:39", "Peter imprisoned at time of Acts 12:3", "Christ called our Passover 1 Corinthians 5:7 Feasts"], "Word": "Passover", "Dictionary": "Naves Topical Index"}, "38": {"Definitions": ["the first of the three great annual festivals of the Isr'lites celebrated in the month Nisan (March-April, from the 14th to the 21st. (Strictly speaking the Passover only applied to the paschal supper and the feast of unleavened bread followed, which was celebrated to the 21st.) (For the corresponding dates in our month, see  Jewish calendar  at the end of this volume.) The following are the principal passages in the Pentateuch relating to the Passover: ( Exodus 12:1-51 ;  13:3-10 ;  23:14-19 ;  34:18-26 ;  Leviticus 23:4-14 ;  Numbers 9:1-14 ;  28:16-25 ;  16:1-6 )  Why instituted  .", "This feast was instituted by God to commemorate the deliverance of the Isr'lites from Egyptian bondage and the sparing of their firstborn when the destroying angel smote the first-born of the Egyptians. The deliverance from Egypt was regarded as the starting-point of the Hebrew nation. The Isr'lites were then raised from the condition of bondmen under a foreign tyrant to that of a free people owing allegiance to no one but Jehovah. The prophet in a later age spoke of the event as  a creation  and  a redemption  of the nation. God declares himself to be \"the Creator of Isr'l.\" The Exodus was thus looked upon as the birth of the nation; the Passover was its annual birthday feast. It was the yearly memorial of the dedication of the people to him who had saved their first-born from the destroyer, in order that they might be made holy to himself.  First celebration of the Passover  .", "On the tenth day of the month, the head of each family was to select from the flock either a lamb or a kid, a male of the first year, without blemish. If his family was too small to eat the whole of the lamb, he was permitted to invite his nearest neighbor to join the party. On the fourteenth day of the month he was to kill his lamb, while the sun was setting. He was then to take blood in a basin and with a sprig of hyssop to sprinkle it on the two side-posts and the lintel of the door of the house. The lamb was then thoroughly roasted, whole. It was expressly forbidden that it should be boiled, or that a bone of it should be broken. Unleavened bread and bitter herbs were to be eaten with the flesh. No male who was uncircumcised was to join the company. Each one was to have his loins girt, to hold a staff in his hand, and to have shoes on his feet. He was to eat in haste, and it would seem that he was to stand during the meal. The number of the party was to be calculated as nearly as possible, so that all the flesh of the lamb might be eaten; but if any portion of it happened to remain, it was to be burned in the morning. No morsel of it was to be carried out of the house. The lambs were selected, on the fourteenth they were slain and the blood sprinkled, and in the following evening, after the fifteenth day of the had commenced the first paschal meal was eaten. At midnight the firstborn of the Egyptians were smitten. The king and his people were now urgent that the Isr'lites should start immediately, and readily bestowed on them supplies for the journey. In such haste did the Isr'lites depart, on that very day, ( Numbers 33:3 ) that they packed up their kneading troughs containing the dough prepared for the morrow's provisions, which was not yet leavened.  Observance of the Passover in later times  .", "As the original institution of the Passover in Egypt preceded the establishment of the priesthood and the regulation of the service of the tabernacle. It necessarily fell short in several particulars of the observance of the festival according to the fully-developed ceremonial law. The head of the family slew the lamb in his own house, not in the holy place; the blood was sprinkled on the doorway, not on the altar. But when the law was perfected, certain particulars were altered in order to assimilate the Passover to the accustomed order of religious service. In the twelfth and thirteenth chapters of Exodus there are not only distinct references to the observance of the festival in future ages (e.g.) ( Exodus 12:2,14,17,24-27,42 ;  13:2,5,8-10 ) but there are several injunctions which were evidently not intended for the first Passover, and which indeed could not possibly have been observed. Besides the private family festival, there were public and national sacrifices offered each of the seven days of unleavened bread. ( Numbers 28:19 ) On the second day also the first-fruits of the barley harvest were offered in the temple. ( Leviticus 23:10 ) In the latter notices of the festival in the books of the law there are particulars added which appear as modifications of the original institution. ( Leviticus 23:10-14 ;  Numbers 28:16-25 ;  16:1-6 ) Hence it is not without reason that the Jewish writers have laid great stress on the distinction between \"the Egyptian Passover\" and \"the perpetual Passover.\"  Mode and order of the paschal meal  .", "All work except that belonging to a few trades connected with daily life was suspended for some hours before the evening of the 14th Nisan. It was not lawful to eat any ordinary food after midday. No male was admitted to the table unless he was circumcised, even if he were of the seed of Isr'l. ( Exodus 12:48 ) It was customary for the number of a party to be not less than ten. When the meal was prepared, the family was placed round the table, the paterfamilias taking a place of honor, probably somewhat raised above the rest. When the party was arranged the first cup of wine was filled, and a blessing was asked by the head of the family on the feast, as well as a special, one on the cup. The bitter herbs were then placed on the table, and a portion of them eaten, either with Or without the sauce. The unleavened bread was handed round next and afterward the lamb was placed on the table in front of the head of the family. The paschal lamb could be legally slain and the blood and fat offered only in the national sanctuary. ( 16:2 ) Before the lamb was eaten the second cup of wine was filled, and the son, in accordance with ( Exodus 12:26 ) asked his father the meaning of the feast. In reply, an account was given of the sufferings of the Isr'lites in Egypt and of their deliverance, with a particular explanation of ( 26:5 ) and the first part of the Hallel (a contraction from  Hallelujah ), Psalms 113, 114, was sung. This being gone through, the lamb was carved and eaten. The third cup of wine was poured out and drunk, and soon afterward the fourth. The second part of the Hallel, Psalms 115 to 118 was then sung. A fifth wine-cup appears to have been occasionally produced, But perhaps only in later times. What was termed the greater Hallel, Psalms 120 to 138 was sung on such occasions. The Isr'lites who lived in the country appear to have been accommodated at the feast by the inhabitants of Jerusalem in their houses, so far its there was room for them. ( Matthew 26:18 ;  Luke 22:10-12 ) Those who could not be received into the city encamped without the walls in tents as the pilgrims now do at Mecca.  The Passover as a type  .", "The Passover was not only commemorative but also typical. \"The deliverance which it commemorated was a type of the great salvation it foretold.\"", "No other shadow of things to come contained in the law can vie with the festival of the Passover in expressiveness and completeness. (1) The paschal lamb must of course be regarded as the leading feature in the ceremonial of the festival. The lamb slain typified Christ the \"Lamb of God.\" slain for the sins of the world. Christ \"our Passover is sacrificed for us.\" ( 1 Corinthians 5:7 ) According to the divine purpose, the true Lamb of God was slain at nearly the same time as \"the Lord's Passover\" at the same season of the year; and at the same time of the day as the daily sacrifice at the temple, the crucifixion beginning at the hour of the morning sacrifice and ending at the hour of the evening sacrifice. That the lamb was to be roasted and not boiled has been supposed to commemorate the haste of the departure of the Isr'lites. It is not difficult to determine the reason of the command \"not a bone of him shall be broken.\" The lamb was to be a symbol of unity", "the unity of the family, the unity of the nation, the unity of God with his people whom he had taken into covenant with himself. (2) The unleavened bread ranks next in importance to the paschal lamb. We are warranted in concluding that unleavened bread had a peculiar sacrificial character, according to the law. It seems more reasonable to accept St, Paul's reference to the subject, ( 1 Corinthians 5:6-8 ) as furnishing the true meaning of the symbol. Fermentation is decomposition, a dissolution of unity. The pure dry biscuit would be an apt emblem of unchanged duration, and, in its freedom from foreign mixture, of purity also. (3) The offering of the omer or first sheaf of the harvest, ( Leviticus 23:10-14 ) signified deliverance from winter the bondage of Egypt being well considered as a winter in the history of the nation. (4) The consecration of the first-fruits, the firstborn of the soil, is an easy type of the consecration of the first born of the Isr'lites, and of our own best selves, to God. Further than this (1) the Passover is a type of deliverance from the slavery of sin. (2) It is the passing over of the doom we deserve for your sins, because the blood of Christ has been applied to us by faith. (3) The sprinkling of the blood upon the door-posts was a symbol of open confession of our allegiance and love. (4) The Passover was useless unless eaten; so we live upon the Lord Jesus Christ. (5) It was eaten with bitter herbs, as we must eat our passover with the bitter herbs of repentance and confession, which yet, like the bitter herbs of the Passover, are a fitting and natural accompaniment. (6) As the Isr'lites ate the Passover all prepared for the journey, so do we with a readiness and desire to enter the active service of Christ, and to go on the journey toward heaven.", "ED.)"], "Word": "Passover", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "39": {"Definitions": ["P'ASSOVER ,  noun   [pass and over.] A feast of the Jews, instituted to commemorate the providential escape of the Hebrews, in Egypt, when God smiting the first-born of the Egyptians, passed over the houses of the Israelites, which were marked with the blood of the paschal lamb.", "1.

The LXX. entitled them  psalmoi  or \"psalms,\" i.e., lyrical pieces to be sung to a musical instrument. The Christian Church obviously received the Psalter from the Jews not only as a constituent portion of the sacred volume of Holy Scripture, but also as the liturgical hymn-book which the Jewish Church had regularly used in the temple.  Division of the Psalms  .", "The book contains 150 psalms, and may be divided into five great divisions or books, which must have been originally formed at different periods. Book I. is, by the superscriptions, entirely Davidic nor do we find in it a trace of any but David's authorship. We may well believe that the compilation of the book was also David's work. Book II. appears by the date of its latest psalm, ( Psalms 46:1 ) ... to have been compiled in the reign of King Hezekiah. It would naturally comprise, 1st, several or most of the Levitical psalms anterior to that date; and 2d, the remainder of the psalms of David previously uncompiled. To these latter the collector after properly appending the single psalm of Solomon has affixed the notice that \"the prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.\" ( Psalms 72:20 ) Book III., the interest of which centers in the times of Hezekiah stretches out, by its last two psalms, to the reign of Manasseh: it was probably compiled in the reign of Josiah. It contains seventeen psalms, from Psalms 73-89 eleven by Asaph, four by the sons of Horah, one (86) by David, and one by Ethan. Book IV. contains the remainder of the psalms up to the date of the captivity, There are seventeen, from Psalms 90-106", "one by Moses, two by David, and the rest anonymous. Book V., the psalms of the return, contains forty-four, from Psalms 107-180", "fifteen by David, one by Solomon and the rest anonymous. There is nothing to distinguish these two books from each other in respect of outward decoration or arrangement and they may have been compiled together in the days of Nehemiah.  Connection of the Psalms with Isr'litish history  .", "The psalm of Moses Psalms 90, which is in point of actual date the earliest, faithfully reflects the long, weary wanderings, the multiplied provocations and the consequent punishments of the wilderness. It is, however, with David that Isr'litish psalmody may be said virtually to commence. Previous mastery over his harp had probably already prepared the way for his future strains, when the anointing oil of Samuel descended upon him, and he began to drink in special measure, from that day forward, of the Spirit of the Lord. It was then that, victorious at home over the mysterious melancholy of Saul and in the held over the vaunting champion of the Philistine hosts, he sang how from even babes and sucklings God had ordained strength because of his enemies. Psalms 8. His next psalms are of a different character; his persecutions at the hands of Saul had commenced. When David's reign has begun, it is still with the most exciting incidents of his history, private or public, that his psalms are mainly associated. There are none to which the period of his reign at Hebron can lay exclusive claim. But after the conquest of Jerusalem his psalmody opened afresh with the solemn removal of the ark to Mount Zion; and in Psalms 24-29 which belong together, we have the earliest definite instance of David's systematic composition or arrangement of psalms for public use. Even of those psalms which cannot be referred to any definite occasion, several reflect the general historical circumstances of the times. Thus Psalms 9 is a thanksgiving for the deliverance of the land of Isr'l from its former heathen oppressors. Psalms 10 is a prayer for the deliverance of the Church from the highhanded oppression exercised from within. The succeeding psalms dwell on the same theme, the virtual internal heathenism by which the Church of God was weighed clown. So that there remain very few e.g. Psalms 15-17,19,32 (with its choral appendage, 23), 37 of which some historical account may not be given. A season of repose near the close of his reign induced David to compose his grand personal thanksgiving for the deliverances of his whole life, Psalms 18 the date of which is approximately determined by the place at which it ia inserted in the history. ( 2 Samuel 22:1 ) ... It was probably at this period that he finally arranged for the sanctuary service that collection of his psalms which now constitutes the first book of the Psalter. The course of David's reign was not, however, as yet complete. The solemn assembly convened by him for the dedication of the materials of the future temple, 1 Chronicles  28, 29, would naturally call forth a renewal of his best efforts to glorify the God of Isr'l in psalms; and to this occasion we doubtless owe the great festal hymns, Psalms 65-68, containing a large review of the past history, present position and prospective glories of God's chosen people. The supplications of Psalms 69, suit best with the renewed distress occasioned by the sedition of Adonijah. Psalms 71 to which Psalms 70 a fragment of a former psalm, is introductory, forms David's parting strain. Yet that the psalmody of Isr'l may not seem finally to terminate with hint, the glories of the future are forthwith anticipated by his son in Psalms 72. The great prophetical ode, Psalms 45, connects itself most readily with the splendors of Jehoshaphat's reign. Psalms 42-44, 74 are best assigned to the reign of Ahaz. The reign of Hezekiah is naturally rich in psalmody, Psalms 46,73,75,76 connect themselves with the resistance to the supremacy of the Assyrians and the divine destruction of their host. We are now brought to a series of psalms of peculiar interest, springing out of the political and religious history of the,separated ten tribes. In date of actual composition they commence before the times of Hezekiah. The earliest is probably Psalms 80 A supplication for the Isr'litish people at the time of the Syrian oppression. All these psalms", "80-83", "are referred by their superscriptions to the Levite singers, and thus beer witness to the efforts of the Levites to reconcile the two branches of the chosen nation. The captivity of Manasseh himself proved to be but temporary; but the sentence which his sins had provoked upon Judah and Jerusalem still remained to be executed, and precluded the hope that God's salvation could be revealed till after such an outpouring of his judgments as the nation had never yet known. Labor and sorrow must be the lot of the present generation; through these mercy might occasionally gleam, but the glory which was eventually to be manifested must be for posterity alone. The psalms of Book IV.", "bear generally the impress of this feeling. We pass to Book V. Psalms 107 is the opening psalm of the return, sung probably at the first feast of tabernacles. Ezra 3 A directly historical character belongs to Psalms 120-134, styled in our Authorized Version \"Songs of Degrees.\" Internal evidence refers these to the period when the Jews under Nehemiah were, in the very face of the enemy, repairing the walls of Jerusalem and the title may well signify \"songs of goings up upon the walls,\" the psalms being from their brevity, well adapted to be sung by the workmen and guards while engaged in their respective duties. Psalms 139 is a psalm of the new birth of Isr'l from the womb of the Babylonish captivity, to a life of righteousness; Psalms 140-143 may be a picture of the trials to which the unrestored exiles were still exposed in the realms of the Gentiles. Henceforward, as we approach the close of the Psalter, its strains rise in cheerfulness; and it fittingly terminates with Psalms 147-150 which were probably sung on the occasion of the thanksgiving procession of Nehe 12, after the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem had been completed.  Moral characteristics of the Psalms  .", "Foremost among these meets us, undoubtedly, the universal recourse to communion with God. Connected with this is the faith by which the psalmist everywhere lives in God rather than in himself. It is of the essence of such faith that his view of the perfections of God should be true and vivid. The Psalter describes God as he is: it glows with testimonies to his power and providence, his love and faithfulness, his holiness and righteousness. The Psalms not only set forth the perfections of God; they proclaim also the duty of worshipping him by the acknowledgment and adoration of his perfections. They encourage all outward rites and means of worship. Among these they recognize the ordinance of sacrifice as in expression of the worshipper's consecration of himself to God's service. But not the less do they repudiate the outward rite when separated from that which it was designed to express. Similar depth is observable in the view taken by the psalmists of human sin. In regard to the law, the psalmist, while warmly acknowledging its excellence, feels yet that it cannot so effectually guide his own unassisted exertions as to preserve him from error Psalms 19. The Psalms bear repeated testimony to the duty of instructing other in the ways of holiness. Psalms 32,34, 51 This brings us to notice, lastly, the faith of the psalmists in righteous recompense to all men according to their deeds. Psalms 37, etc.  Prophetical character of the Psalms  .", "The moral struggle between godliness and ungodliness, so vividly depicted in the Psalms, culminates in Holy Scripture, in the life of the Incarnate Son of God upon earth. It only remains to show that the Psalms themselves definitely anticipated this culmination. Now there are in the Psalter at least three psalms of which the interest evidently centers in a person distinct from the speaker, and which, since they cannot without violence to the language be interpreted of any but the Messiah, may be termed directly and exclusively Messianic. We refer to Psalms 2,45,110, to which may perhaps be added, Psalms 72. It would be strange if these few psalms stood, in their prophetical significance absolutely alone among the rest. And hence the impossibility of viewing the psalms generally, notwithstanding the drapery in which they are outwardly clothed, as simply the past devotions of the historical David or the historical Isr'l.

The Christian Church obviously received the Psalter from the Jews not only as a constituent portion of the sacred volume of Holy Scripture, but also as the liturgical hymn-book which the Jewish Church had regularly used in the temple.  Division of the Psalms  .", "The book contains 150 psalms, and may be divided into five great divisions or books, which must have been originally formed at different periods. Book I. is, by the superscriptions, entirely Davidic nor do we find in it a trace of any but David's authorship. We may well believe that the compilation of the book was also David's work. Book II. appears by the date of its latest psalm, ( Psalms 46:1 ) ... to have been compiled in the reign of King Hezekiah. It would naturally comprise, 1st, several or most of the Levitical psalms anterior to that date; and 2d, the remainder of the psalms of David previously uncompiled. To these latter the collector after properly appending the single psalm of Solomon has affixed the notice that \"the prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.\" ( Psalms 72:20 ) Book III., the interest of which centers in the times of Hezekiah stretches out, by its last two psalms, to the reign of Manasseh: it was probably compiled in the reign of Josiah. It contains seventeen psalms, from Psalms 73-89 eleven by Asaph, four by the sons of Horah, one (86) by David, and one by Ethan. Book IV. contains the remainder of the psalms up to the date of the captivity, There are seventeen, from Psalms 90-106", "one by Moses, two by David, and the rest anonymous. Book V., the psalms of the return, contains forty-four, from Psalms 107-180", "fifteen by David, one by Solomon and the rest anonymous. There is nothing to distinguish these two books from each other in respect of outward decoration or arrangement and they may have been compiled together in the days of Nehemiah.  Connection of the Psalms with Isr'litish history  .", "The psalm of Moses Psalms 90, which is in point of actual date the earliest, faithfully reflects the long, weary wanderings, the multiplied provocations and the consequent punishments of the wilderness. It is, however, with David that Isr'litish psalmody may be said virtually to commence. Previous mastery over his harp had probably already prepared the way for his future strains, when the anointing oil of Samuel descended upon him, and he began to drink in special measure, from that day forward, of the Spirit of the Lord. It was then that, victorious at home over the mysterious melancholy of Saul and in the held over the vaunting champion of the Philistine hosts, he sang how from even babes and sucklings God had ordained strength because of his enemies. Psalms 8. His next psalms are of a different character; his persecutions at the hands of Saul had commenced. When David's reign has begun, it is still with the most exciting incidents of his history, private or public, that his psalms are mainly associated. There are none to which the period of his reign at Hebron can lay exclusive claim. But after the conquest of Jerusalem his psalmody opened afresh with the solemn removal of the ark to Mount Zion; and in Psalms 24-29 which belong together, we have the earliest definite instance of David's systematic composition or arrangement of psalms for public use. Even of those psalms which cannot be referred to any definite occasion, several reflect the general historical circumstances of the times. Thus Psalms 9 is a thanksgiving for the deliverance of the land of Isr'l from its former heathen oppressors. Psalms 10 is a prayer for the deliverance of the Church from the highhanded oppression exercised from within. The succeeding psalms dwell on the same theme, the virtual internal heathenism by which the Church of God was weighed clown. So that there remain very few e.g. Psalms 15-17,19,32 (with its choral appendage, 23), 37 of which some historical account may not be given. A season of repose near the close of his reign induced David to compose his grand personal thanksgiving for the deliverances of his whole life, Psalms 18 the date of which is approximately determined by the place at which it ia inserted in the history. ( 2 Samuel 22:1 ) ... It was probably at this period that he finally arranged for the sanctuary service that collection of his psalms which now constitutes the first book of the Psalter. The course of David's reign was not, however, as yet complete. The solemn assembly convened by him for the dedication of the materials of the future temple, 1 Chronicles  28, 29, would naturally call forth a renewal of his best efforts to glorify the God of Isr'l in psalms; and to this occasion we doubtless owe the great festal hymns, Psalms 65-68, containing a large review of the past history, present position and prospective glories of God's chosen people. The supplications of Psalms 69, suit best with the renewed distress occasioned by the sedition of Adonijah. Psalms 71 to which Psalms 70 a fragment of a former psalm, is introductory, forms David's parting strain. Yet that the psalmody of Isr'l may not seem finally to terminate with hint, the glories of the future are forthwith anticipated by his son in Psalms 72. The great prophetical ode, Psalms 45, connects itself most readily with the splendors of Jehoshaphat's reign. Psalms 42-44, 74 are best assigned to the reign of Ahaz. The reign of Hezekiah is naturally rich in psalmody, Psalms 46,73,75,76 connect themselves with the resistance to the supremacy of the Assyrians and the divine destruction of their host. We are now brought to a series of psalms of peculiar interest, springing out of the political and religious history of the,separated ten tribes. In date of actual composition they commence before the times of Hezekiah. The earliest is probably Psalms 80 A supplication for the Isr'litish people at the time of the Syrian oppression. All these psalms", "80-83", "are referred by their superscriptions to the Levite singers, and thus beer witness to the efforts of the Levites to reconcile the two branches of the chosen nation. The captivity of Manasseh himself proved to be but temporary; but the sentence which his sins had provoked upon Judah and Jerusalem still remained to be executed, and precluded the hope that God's salvation could be revealed till after such an outpouring of his judgments as the nation had never yet known. Labor and sorrow must be the lot of the present generation; through these mercy might occasionally gleam, but the glory which was eventually to be manifested must be for posterity alone. The psalms of Book IV.", "bear generally the impress of this feeling. We pass to Book V. Psalms 107 is the opening psalm of the return, sung probably at the first feast of tabernacles. Ezra 3 A directly historical character belongs to Psalms 120-134, styled in our Authorized Version \"Songs of Degrees.\" Internal evidence refers these to the period when the Jews under Nehemiah were, in the very face of the enemy, repairing the walls of Jerusalem and the title may well signify \"songs of goings up upon the walls,\" the psalms being from their brevity, well adapted to be sung by the workmen and guards while engaged in their respective duties. Psalms 139 is a psalm of the new birth of Isr'l from the womb of the Babylonish captivity, to a life of righteousness; Psalms 140-143 may be a picture of the trials to which the unrestored exiles were still exposed in the realms of the Gentiles. Henceforward, as we approach the close of the Psalter, its strains rise in cheerfulness; and it fittingly terminates with Psalms 147-150 which were probably sung on the occasion of the thanksgiving procession of Nehe 12, after the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem had been completed.  Moral characteristics of the Psalms  .", "Foremost among these meets us, undoubtedly, the universal recourse to communion with God. Connected with this is the faith by which the psalmist everywhere lives in God rather than in himself. It is of the essence of such faith that his view of the perfections of God should be true and vivid. The Psalter describes God as he is: it glows with testimonies to his power and providence, his love and faithfulness, his holiness and righteousness. The Psalms not only set forth the perfections of God; they proclaim also the duty of worshipping him by the acknowledgment and adoration of his perfections. They encourage all outward rites and means of worship. Among these they recognize the ordinance of sacrifice as in expression of the worshipper's consecration of himself to God's service. But not the less do they repudiate the outward rite when separated from that which it was designed to express. Similar depth is observable in the view taken by the psalmists of human sin. In regard to the law, the psalmist, while warmly acknowledging its excellence, feels yet that it cannot so effectually guide his own unassisted exertions as to preserve him from error Psalms 19. The Psalms bear repeated testimony to the duty of instructing other in the ways of holiness. Psalms 32,34, 51 This brings us to notice, lastly, the faith of the psalmists in righteous recompense to all men according to their deeds. Psalms 37, etc.  Prophetical character of the Psalms  .", "The moral struggle between godliness and ungodliness, so vividly depicted in the Psalms, culminates in Holy Scripture, in the life of the Incarnate Son of God upon earth. It only remains to show that the Psalms themselves definitely anticipated this culmination. Now there are in the Psalter at least three psalms of which the interest evidently centers in a person distinct from the speaker, and which, since they cannot without violence to the language be interpreted of any but the Messiah, may be termed directly and exclusively Messianic. We refer to Psalms 2,45,110, to which may perhaps be added, Psalms 72. It would be strange if these few psalms stood, in their prophetical significance absolutely alone among the rest.

The original Hebrew word  Pelesheth  to the Hebrews signified merely the long and broad strip of maritime plain inhabited by their encroaching neighbors; nor does it appear that at first it signified more to the Greeks. As lying next the sea, and as being also the high road from Egypt to Phoenicia and the richer regions no of it, the Philistine plain became sooner known to the western world than the country farther inland, and was called by them Syria Palestina-Philistine Syria. From thence it was gradually extended to the country farther inland, till in the Roman and later Greek authors, both heathen sad Christian, it became the usual appellation for the whole country of the Jews, both west and east of Jordan. The word is now so commonly employed in our more familiar language to destinate the whole country of Isr'l that although biblically a misnomer, it has been chosen here as the most convenient heading under which to give a general description of THE HOLY LAND, embracing those points which have not been treated under the separate headings of cities or tribes.

It is also called \"the holy land\" ( Zechariah 2:12 ), the \"land of Jehovah\" ( Hosea 9:3 ;  Psalms 85:1 ), the \"land of promise\" ( Hebrews 11:9 ), because promised to Abraham ( Genesis 12:7 ;  24:7 ), the \"land of Canaan\" ( Genesis 12:5 ), the \"land of Israel\" ( 1 Samuel 13:19 ), and the \"land of Judah\" ( Isaiah 19:17 ).", "The territory promised as an inheritance to the seed of Abraham ( Genesis 15:18-21 ;  Numbers 34:1-12 ) was bounded on the east by the river Euphrates, on the west by the Mediterranean, on the north by the \"entrance of Hamath,\" and on the south by the \"river of Egypt.\" This extent of territory, about 60,000 square miles, was at length conquered by David, and was ruled over also by his son Solomon ( 2 Samuel 8 ;  1 Chronicles 18 ;  1 Kings 4:1, 21 ). This vast empire was the Promised Land; but Palestine was only a part of it, terminating in the north at the southern extremity of the Lebanon range, and in the south in the wilderness of Paran, thus extending in all to about 144 miles in length. Its average breadth was about 60 miles from the Mediterranean on the west to beyond the Jordan. It has fittingly been designated \"the least of all lands.\" Western Palestine, on the south of Gaza, is only about 40 miles in breadth from the Mediterranean to the Dead Sea, narrowing gradually toward the north, where it is only 20 miles from the sea-coast to the Jordan.", "Palestine, \"set in the midst\" ( Ezekiel 5:5 ) of all other lands, is the most remarkable country on the face of the earth. No single country of such an extent has so great a variety of climate, and hence also of plant and animal life. Moses describes it as \"a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills; a land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey; a land wherein thou shalt not eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass\" ( Deuteronomy 8:7-9) .", "\"In the time of Christ the country looked, in all probability, much as now. The whole land consists of rounded limestone hills, fretted into countless stony valleys, offering but rarely level tracts, of which Esdraelon alone, below Nazareth, is large enough to be seen on the map. The original woods had for ages disappeared, though the slopes were dotted, as now, with figs, olives, and other fruit-trees where there was any soil. Permanent streams were even then unknown, the passing rush of winter torrents being all that was seen among the hills. The autumn and spring rains, caught in deep cisterns hewn out like huge underground jars in the soft limestone, with artificial mud-banked ponds still found near all villages, furnished water. Hills now bare, or at best rough with stunted growth, were then terraced, so as to grow vines, olives, and grain. To-day almost desolate, the country then teemed with population. Wine-presses cut in the rocks, endless terraces, and the ruins of old vineyard towers are now found amidst solitudes overgrown for ages with thorns and thistles, or with wild shrubs and poor gnarled scrub\" (Geikie's Life of Christ).", "From an early period the land was inhabited by the descendants of Canaan, who retained possession of the whole land \"from Sidon to Gaza\" till the time of the conquest by Joshua, when it was occupied by the twelve tribes. Two tribes and a half had their allotments given them by Moses on the east of the Jordan ( Deuteronomy 3:12-20 ; comp.  Numbers 1:17-46 ;  Joshua 4:12-13 ). The remaining tribes had their portion on the west of Jordan.", "From the conquest till the time of Saul, about four hundred years, the people were governed by judges. For a period of one hundred and twenty years the kingdom retained its unity while it was ruled by Saul and David and Solomon. On the death of Solomon, his son Rehoboam ascended the throne; but his conduct was such that ten of the tribes revolted, and formed an independent monarchy, called the kingdom of Israel, or the northern kingdom, the capital of which was first Shechem and afterwards Samaria. This kingdom was destroyed. The Israelites were carried captive by Shalmanezer, king of Assyria, B.C. 722, after an independent existence of two hundred and fifty-three years. The place of the captives carried away was supplied by tribes brought from the east, and thus was formed the Samaritan nation ( 2 Kings 17:24-29 ).", "Nebuchadnezzar came up against the kingdom of the two tribes, the kingdom of Judah, the capital of which was Jerusalem, one hundred and thirty-four years after the overthrow of the kingdom of Israel. He overthrew the city, plundered the temple, and carried the people into captivity to Babylon (B.C. 587), where they remained seventy years. At the close of the period of the Captivity, they returned to their own land, under the edict of Cyrus ( Ezra 1:1-4) . They rebuilt the city and temple, and restored the old Jewish commonwealth.", "For a while after the Restoration the Jews were ruled by Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah, and afterwards by the high priests, assisted by the Sanhedrin. After the death of Alexander the Great at Babylon (B.C. 323), his vast empire was divided between his four generals. Egypt, Arabia, Palestine, and Coele-Syria fell to the lot of Ptolemy Lagus. Ptolemy took possession of Palestine in B.C. 320, and carried nearly one hundred thousand of the inhabitants of Jerusalem into Egypt. He made Alexandria the capital of his kingdom, and treated the Jews with consideration, confirming them in the enjoyment of many privileges.", "After suffering persecution at the hands of Ptolemy's successors, the Jews threw off the Egyptian yoke, and became subject to Antiochus the Great, the king of Syria. The cruelty and opression of the successors of Antiochus at length led to the revolt under the Maccabees (B.C. 163), when they threw off the Syrian yoke.", "In the year B.C. 68, Palestine was reduced by Pompey the Great to a Roman province. He laid the walls of the city in ruins, and massacred some twelve thousand of the inhabitants. He left the temple, however, unijured. About twenty-five years after this the Jews revolted and cast off the Roman yoke. They were however, subdued by Herod the Great (q.v.). The city and the temple were destroyed, and many of the inhabitants were put to death. About B.C. 20, Herod proceeded to rebuild the city and restore the ruined temple, which in about nine years and a half was so far completed that the sacred services could be resumed in it (comp.  John 2:20 ). He was succeeded by his son Archelaus, who was deprived of his power, however, by Augustus, A.D. 6, when Palestine became a Roman province, ruled by Roman governors or procurators. Pontius Pilate was the fifth of these procurators. He was appointed to his office A.D. 25.", "Exclusive of Idumea, the kingdom of Herod the Great comprehended the whole of the country originally divided among the twelve tribes, which he divided into four provinces or districts. This division was recognized so long as Palestine was under the Roman dominion. These four provinces were, (1) Judea, the southern portion of the country; (2) Samaria, the middle province, the northern boundary of which ran along the hills to the south of the plain of Esdraelon; (3) Galilee, the northern province; and (4) Peraea (a Greek name meaning the \"opposite country\"), the country lying east of the Jordan and the Dead Sea. This province was subdivided into these districts, (1) Peraea proper, lying between the rivers Arnon and Jabbok; (2) Galaaditis (Gilead); (3) Batanaea; (4) Gaulonitis (Jaulan); (5) Ituraea or Auranitis, the ancient Bashan; (6) Trachonitis; (7) Abilene; (8) Decapolis, i.e., the region of the ten cities.

Psalms 45:1 ). This Hebrew word is the first and the most generally used for a prophet. In the time of Samuel another word, ro'eh, \"seer\", began to be used ( 1 Samuel 9:9 ). It occurs seven times in reference to Samuel. Afterwards another word, hozeh, \"seer\" ( 2 Samuel 24:11 ), was employed. In  1 Chronicles 29:29  all these three words are used- \"Samuel the seer (ro'eh), Nathan the prophet (nabi'), Gad the seer\" (hozeh). In  Joshua 13:22  Balaam is called (Heb.) a kosem \"diviner,\" a word used only of a false prophet.", "The \"prophet\" proclaimed the message given to him, as the \"seer\" beheld the vision of God. (See  Numbers 12:6, 8 .) Thus a prophet was a spokesman for God; he spake in God's name and by his authority ( Exodus 7:1 ). He is the mouth by which God speaks to men ( Jeremiah 1:9 ;  Isaiah 51:16 ), and hence what the prophet says is not of man but of God ( 2 Peter 1:20, 21 ; comp.  Hebrews 3:7 ;  Acts 4:25 ;  28:25 ). Prophets were the immediate organs of God for the communication of his mind and will to men ( Deuteronomy 18:18, 19 ). The whole Word of God may in this general sense be spoken of as prophetic, inasmuch as it was written by men who received the revelation they communicated from God, no matter what its nature might be. The foretelling of future events was not a necessary but only an incidental part of the prophetic office. The great task assigned to the prophets whom God raised up among the people was \"to correct moral and religious abuses, to proclaim the great moral and religious truths which are connected with the character of God, and which lie at the foundation of his government.\"", "Any one being a spokesman for God to man might thus be called a prophet. Thus Enoch, Abraham, and the patriarchs, as bearers of God's message ( Genesis 20:7 ;  Exodus 7:1 ;  Psalms 105:15 ), as also Moses ( Deuteronomy 18:15 ;  34:10 ;  Hosea 12:13 ), are ranked among the prophets. The seventy elders of Israel ( Numbers 11:16-29 ), \"when the spirit rested upon them, prophesied;\" Asaph and Jeduthun \"prophesied with a harp\" ( 1 Chronicles 25:3 ). Miriam and Deborah were prophetesses ( Exodus 15:20 ;  Judges 4:4 ). The title thus has a general application to all who have messages from God to men.", "But while the prophetic gift was thus exercised from the beginning, the prophetical order as such began with Samuel. Colleges, \"schools of the prophets\", were instituted for the training of prophets, who were constituted, a distinct order ( 1 Samuel 19:18-24 ;  2 Kings 2:3, 15 ;  4:38 ), which continued to the close of the Old Testament. Such \"schools\" were established at Ramah, Bethel, Gilgal, Gibeah, and Jericho. The \"sons\" or \"disciples\" of the prophets were young men ( 2 Kings 5:22 ;  9:1, 4 ) who lived together at these different \"schools\" ( 4:38-41 ). These young men were taught not only the rudiments of secular knowledge, but they were brought up to exercise the office of prophet, \"to preach pure morality and the heart-felt worship of Jehovah, and to act along and co-ordinately with the priesthood and monarchy in guiding the state aright and checking all attempts at illegality and tyranny.\"", "In New Testament times the prophetical office was continued. Our Lord is frequently spoken of as a prophet ( Luke 13:33 ;  24:19 ). He was and is the great Prophet of the Church. There was also in the Church a distinct order of prophets ( 1 Corinthians 12:28 ;  Ephesians 2:20 ;  3:5 ), who made new revelations from God. They differed from the \"teacher,\" whose office it was to impart truths already revealed.", "Of the Old Testament prophets there are sixteen, whose prophecies form part of the inspired canon. These are divided into four groups-", "1.  The prophets of the northern kingdom (Israel), viz., Hosea, Amos, Joel, Jonah.", "2.  The prophets of Judah, viz., Isaiah, Jeremiah, Obadiah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah.", "3.  The prophets of Captivity, viz., Ezekiel and Daniel.", "4.  The prophets of the Restoration, viz., Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi."], "Word": "Prophet", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "2": {"Definitions": ["The ordinary Hebrew word for prophet is  nabi  , derived from a verb signifying \"to bubble forth\" like a fountain; hence the word means one who  announces  or  pours forth  the declarations of God. The English word comes from the Greek prophetes ( profetes ), which signifies in classical Greek  one who speaks for another  , especially  one who speaks for a god  , and so interprets his will to man; hence its essential meaning is \"an interpreter.\" The use of the word in its modern sense as \"one who predicts\" is post-classical. The larger sense of  interpretation  has not, however, been lost. In fact the English word ways been used in a closer sense. The different meanings or shades of meanings in which the abstract noun is employed in Scripture have been drawn out by Locke as follows: \"Prophecy comprehends three things: prediction; singing by the dictate of the Spirit; and understanding and explaining the mysterious, hidden sense of Scripture by an immediate illumination and motion of the Spirit.\"  Order and office  .", "The sacerdotal order was originally the instrument by which the members of the Jewish theocracy were taught and governed in things spiritual. Teaching by act and teaching by word were alike their task. But during the time of the judges, the priesthood sank into a state of degeneracy, and the people were no longer affected by the acted lessons of the ceremonial service. They required less enigmatic warnings and exhortations, under these circumstances a new moral power was evoked the Prophetic Order. Samuel himself Levite of the family of Kohath, ( 1 Chronicles 6:28 ) and almost certainly a priest, was the instrument used at once for effecting a reform in the sacerdotal order ( 1 Chronicles 9:22 ) and for giving to the prophets a position of importance which they had never before held. Nevertheless it is not to be supposed that Samuel created the prophetic order as a new thing before unknown. The germs both of the prophetic and of the regal order are found in the law as given to the Isr'lites by Moses, ( 13:1 ;  18:20 ;  17:18 ) but they were not yet developed, because there was not yet the demand for them. Samuel took measures to make his work of restoration permanent as well as effective for the moment. For this purpose he instituted companies or colleges of prophets. One we find in his lifetime at Ramah, ( 1 Samuel 19:19,20 ) others afterward at Bethel, ( 2 Kings 2:3 ) Jericho, ( 2 Kings 2:2,5 ) Gilgal; ( 2 Kings 4:38 ) and elsewhere. ( 2 Kings 6:1 ) Their constitution and object similar to those of theological colleges. Into them were gathered promising students, and here they were trained for the office which they were afterward destined to fulfill. So successful were these institutions that from the time of Samuel to the closing of the canon of the Old Testament there seems never to have been wanting due supply of men to keep up the line of official prophets. Their chief subject of study was, no doubt, the law and its interpretation; oral, as distinct from symbolical, teaching being thenceforward tacitly transferred from the priestly to the prophetic order. Subsidiary subjects of instruction were music and sacred poetry, both of which had been connected with prophecy from the time of Moses ( Exodus 15:20 ) and the judges. ( Judges 4:4 ;  5:1 ) But to belong to the prophetic order and to possess the prophetic gift are not convertible terms. Generally, the inspired prophet came from the college of prophets, and belonged to prophetic order; but this was not always the case. Thus Amos though called to the prophetic  office  did not belong to the prophetic order. ( Amos 7:14 ) The sixteen prophets whose books are in the canon have that place of honor because they were endowed with the prophetic gift us well as ordinarily (so far as we know) belonging to the prophetic order.

The essence of purification, in all eases, consisted in the use of water, whether by way of ablution or aspersion; but in the  majora delicta  of legal uncleanness, sacrifices of various kinds were added and the ceremonies throughout bore an expiatory character. Ablution of the person and of the clothes was required in the cases mentioned in ( Leviticus 15:18 ;  11:25,40 ;  15:18,17 ) In cases of childbirth the sacrifice was increased to a lamb of the first year, with a pigeon or turtle-dove.

The purification of the leper was a yet more formal proceeding, and indicated the highest pitch of uncleanness. The rites are described in ( Leviticus 14:4-32 ) The necessity of purification was extended in the post-Babylonian Period to a variety of unauthorized cases. Cups and pots and brazen vessels were washed as a matter of ritual observance. ( Mark 7:4 ) The washing of the hands before meals was conducted in a formal manner.

Thus the religious instruction of the people in the country generally was left to the heads of families, until the establishment of synagogues, an event which did not take place till the return from the Captivity, and which was the main source of the freedom from idolatry that became as marked a feature of the Jewish people thenceforward as its practice had been hitherto their great national sin.\"", "The whole priestly system of the Jews was typical.

There is now no human priesthood. (See also Epistle to the Hebrews throughout.) The term \"priest\" is indeed applied to believers ( 1 Peter 2:9 ;  Revelation 1:6 ), but in these cases it implies no sacerdotal functions.

Origin.", "The idea of a priesthood connects itself in all its forms, pure or corrupted, with the consciousness, more or less distinct of sin. Men feel that they have broken a law. The power above them is holier than they are, and they dare not approach it. They crave for the intervention of some one of whom they can think as likely to be more acceptable than themselves. He must offer up their prayers, thanksgivings, sacrifices. He becomes their representative in \"things pertaining unto God.\" He may become also (though this does not always follow) the representative of God to man. The functions of the priest and prophet may exist in the same person. No trace of a hereditary or caste priesthood meets us in the worship of the patriarchal age. Once and once only does the word  cohen  meet us as belonging to a ritual earlier than the time of Abraham. Melchizedek is \"the priest of the most high God.\" ( Genesis 14:18 ) In the worship of the patriarchs themselves, the chief of the family, as such, acted as the priest. The office descended with the birthright, and might apparently he transferred with it.  When established.", "The priesthood was first established in the family of Aaron, and all the sons of Aaron were priests. They stood between the high priest on the one hand and the Levites on the other. [HIGH PRIEST; LEVITES] The ceremony of their consecration is described in HIGH PRIEST - 1986 ( Exodus 29:1 ;  Leviticus 8:1 ) ...  Dress.", "The dress which the priests wore during their ministrations consisted of linen drawers, with a close-fitting cassock, also of linen, white, but with a diamond or chess-board pattern on it. This came nearly to the feet, and was to be worn in its garment shape. Comp. ( John 19:23 ) The white cassock was gathered round the body with a girdle of needle work, in which, as in the more gorgeous belt of the high priest, blue, purple and scarlet were intermingled with white, and worked in the form of flowers. ( Exodus 28:39,40 ;  39:2 ;  Ezekiel 44:17-19 ) Upon their heads the were to wear caps or bonnets in the form of a cup-shaped flower, also of fine linen. In all their acts of ministration they were to be bare footed.  Duties  .", "The chief duties of the priests were to watch over the fire on the altar of burnt offering, and to keep it burning evermore both by day and night, ( Leviticus 6:12 ;  2 Chronicles 13:11 ) to feed the golden lamp outside the vail with oil ( Exodus 27:20,21 ;  Leviticus 24:2 ) to offer the morning and evening sacrifices, each accompanied with a meet offering and a drink offering, at the door of the tabernacle. ( Exodus 29:38-44 ) They were also to teach the children of Isr'l the statutes of the Lord. ( Leviticus 10:11 ;  33:10 ;  2 Chronicles 15:3 ;  Ezekiel 44:23,24 ) During the journeys in the wilderness it belonged to them to cover the ark and all the vessels of the sanctuary with a purple or scarlet cloth before the Levites might approach them. ( Numbers 4:5-15 ) As the people started on each days march they were to blow \"an alarm\" with long silver trumpets. ( Numbers 10:1-8 ) Other instruments of music might be used by the more highly-trained Levites and the schools of the prophets, but the trumpets belonged only to the priests, The presence of the priests on the held of battle, ( 1 Chronicles 12:23,27 ;  2 Chronicles 20:21,22 ) led, in the later periods of Jewish history, to the special appointment at such times of a war priest. Other functions were hinted at in Deuteronomy which might have given them greater influence as the educators and civilizers of the people. They were to act (whether individually or collectively does not distinctly appear) as a court of appeal in the more difficult controversies in criminal or civil cases. ( 17:8-13 ) It must remain doubtful however how far this order kept its ground during the storms and changes that followed, Functions such as these were clearly incompatible with the common activities of men.

Origin.", "The idea of a priesthood connects itself in all its forms, pure or corrupted, with the consciousness, more or less distinct of sin. Men feel that they have broken a law. The power above them is holier than they are, and they dare not approach it. They crave for the intervention of some one of whom they can think as likely to be more acceptable than themselves. He must offer up their prayers, thanksgivings, sacrifices. He becomes their representative in \"things pertaining unto God.\" He may become also (though this does not always follow) the representative of God to man. The functions of the priest and prophet may exist in the same person. No trace of a hereditary or caste priesthood meets us in the worship of the patriarchal age. Once and once only does the word  cohen  meet us as belonging to a ritual earlier than the time of Abraham. Melchizedek is \"the priest of the most high God.\" ( Genesis 14:18 ) In the worship of the patriarchs themselves, the chief of the family, as such, acted as the priest. The office descended with the birthright, and might apparently he transferred with it.  When established.", "The priesthood was first established in the family of Aaron, and all the sons of Aaron were priests.

Dress.", "The dress which the priests wore during their ministrations consisted of linen drawers, with a close-fitting cassock, also of linen, white, but with a diamond or chess-board pattern on it. This came nearly to the feet, and was to be worn in its garment shape. Comp. ( John 19:23 ) The white cassock was gathered round the body with a girdle of needle work, in which, as in the more gorgeous belt of the high priest, blue, purple and scarlet were intermingled with white, and worked in the form of flowers. ( Exodus 28:39,40 ;  39:2 ;  Ezekiel 44:17-19 ) Upon their heads the were to wear caps or bonnets in the form of a cup-shaped flower, also of fine linen. In all their acts of ministration they were to be bare footed.  Duties  .", "The chief duties of the priests were to watch over the fire on the altar of burnt offering, and to keep it burning evermore both by day and night, ( Leviticus 6:12 ;  2 Chronicles 13:11 ) to feed the golden lamp outside the vail with oil ( Exodus 27:20,21 ;  Leviticus 24:2 ) to offer the morning and evening sacrifices, each accompanied with a meet offering and a drink offering, at the door of the tabernacle. ( Exodus 29:38-44 ) They were also to teach the children of Isr'l the statutes of the Lord. ( Leviticus 10:11 ;  33:10 ;  2 Chronicles 15:3 ;  Ezekiel 44:23,24 ) During the journeys in the wilderness it belonged to them to cover the ark and all the vessels of the sanctuary with a purple or scarlet cloth before the Levites might approach them. ( Numbers 4:5-15 ) As the people started on each days march they were to blow \"an alarm\" with long silver trumpets. ( Numbers 10:1-8 ) Other instruments of music might be used by the more highly-trained Levites and the schools of the prophets, but the trumpets belonged only to the priests, The presence of the priests on the held of battle, ( 1 Chronicles 12:23,27 ;  2 Chronicles 20:21,22 ) led, in the later periods of Jewish history, to the special appointment at such times of a war priest. Other functions were hinted at in Deuteronomy which might have given them greater influence as the educators and civilizers of the people. They were to act (whether individually or collectively does not distinctly appear) as a court of appeal in the more difficult controversies in criminal or civil cases.

The ancient viol was a six-stringed guitar. In the Prayer Book version of the Psalms the Hebrew word is rendered \"lute.\" This instrument resembled the guitar, but was superior in tone, being larger, and having a convex back, somewhat like the vertical section of a gourd, or more nearly resembling that of a pear. These three instruments, the psaltery or sautry, the viol and lute, are frequently associated in the old English poets and were clearly instruments resembling each other though still different. The Greek psalterium ( psalterion ), from which our word is derived, denotes an instrument played with the fingers instead of a plectrum or quill, the verb being used of twanging the bow-string. It is impossible to say positively with what instrument the  nebel  of the Hebrew exactly corresponded, From the fact that  nebel  in Hebrew also signifies a wine-bottle or skin it has been conjectured that the term when applied to a musical instrument denotes a kind of bagpipe. The psalteries of David were made of cypress, ( 2 Samuel 6:5 ) those of Solomon of algum Or almug trees.

The LXX. entitled them  psalmoi  or \"psalms,\" i.e., lyrical pieces to be sung to a musical instrument. The Christian Church obviously received the Psalter from the Jews not only as a constituent portion of the sacred volume of Holy Scripture, but also as the liturgical hymn-book which the Jewish Church had regularly used in the temple.  Division of the Psalms  .", "The book contains 150 psalms, and may be divided into five great divisions or books, which must have been originally formed at different periods. Book I. is, by the superscriptions, entirely Davidic nor do we find in it a trace of any but David's authorship. We may well believe that the compilation of the book was also David's work. Book II. appears by the date of its latest psalm, ( Psalms 46:1 ) ... to have been compiled in the reign of King Hezekiah. It would naturally comprise, 1st, several or most of the Levitical psalms anterior to that date; and 2d, the remainder of the psalms of David previously uncompiled. To these latter the collector after properly appending the single psalm of Solomon has affixed the notice that \"the prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.\" ( Psalms 72:20 ) Book III., the interest of which centers in the times of Hezekiah stretches out, by its last two psalms, to the reign of Manasseh: it was probably compiled in the reign of Josiah. It contains seventeen psalms, from Psalms 73-89 eleven by Asaph, four by the sons of Horah, one (86) by David, and one by Ethan. Book IV. contains the remainder of the psalms up to the date of the captivity, There are seventeen, from Psalms 90-106", "one by Moses, two by David, and the rest anonymous. Book V., the psalms of the return, contains forty-four, from Psalms 107-180", "fifteen by David, one by Solomon and the rest anonymous. There is nothing to distinguish these two books from each other in respect of outward decoration or arrangement and they may have been compiled together in the days of Nehemiah.  Connection of the Psalms with Isr'litish history  .", "The psalm of Moses Psalms 90, which is in point of actual date the earliest, faithfully reflects the long, weary wanderings, the multiplied provocations and the consequent punishments of the wilderness. It is, however, with David that Isr'litish psalmody may be said virtually to commence. Previous mastery over his harp had probably already prepared the way for his future strains, when the anointing oil of Samuel descended upon him, and he began to drink in special measure, from that day forward, of the Spirit of the Lord. It was then that, victorious at home over the mysterious melancholy of Saul and in the held over the vaunting champion of the Philistine hosts, he sang how from even babes and sucklings God had ordained strength because of his enemies. Psalms 8. His next psalms are of a different character; his persecutions at the hands of Saul had commenced. When David's reign has begun, it is still with the most exciting incidents of his history, private or public, that his psalms are mainly associated. There are none to which the period of his reign at Hebron can lay exclusive claim. But after the conquest of Jerusalem his psalmody opened afresh with the solemn removal of the ark to Mount Zion; and in Psalms 24-29 which belong together, we have the earliest definite instance of David's systematic composition or arrangement of psalms for public use. Even of those psalms which cannot be referred to any definite occasion, several reflect the general historical circumstances of the times. Thus Psalms 9 is a thanksgiving for the deliverance of the land of Isr'l from its former heathen oppressors. Psalms 10 is a prayer for the deliverance of the Church from the highhanded oppression exercised from within. The succeeding psalms dwell on the same theme, the virtual internal heathenism by which the Church of God was weighed clown. So that there remain very few e.g. Psalms 15-17,19,32 (with its choral appendage, 23), 37 of which some historical account may not be given. A season of repose near the close of his reign induced David to compose his grand personal thanksgiving for the deliverances of his whole life, Psalms 18 the date of which is approximately determined by the place at which it ia inserted in the history. ( 2 Samuel 22:1 ) ... It was probably at this period that he finally arranged for the sanctuary service that collection of his psalms which now constitutes the first book of the Psalter. The course of David's reign was not, however, as yet complete. The solemn assembly convened by him for the dedication of the materials of the future temple, 1 Chronicles  28, 29, would naturally call forth a renewal of his best efforts to glorify the God of Isr'l in psalms; and to this occasion we doubtless owe the great festal hymns, Psalms 65-68, containing a large review of the past history, present position and prospective glories of God's chosen people. The supplications of Psalms 69, suit best with the renewed distress occasioned by the sedition of Adonijah. Psalms 71 to which Psalms 70 a fragment of a former psalm, is introductory, forms David's parting strain. Yet that the psalmody of Isr'l may not seem finally to terminate with hint, the glories of the future are forthwith anticipated by his son in Psalms 72. The great prophetical ode, Psalms 45, connects itself most readily with the splendors of Jehoshaphat's reign. Psalms 42-44, 74 are best assigned to the reign of Ahaz. The reign of Hezekiah is naturally rich in psalmody, Psalms 46,73,75,76 connect themselves with the resistance to the supremacy of the Assyrians and the divine destruction of their host. We are now brought to a series of psalms of peculiar interest, springing out of the political and religious history of the,separated ten tribes. In date of actual composition they commence before the times of Hezekiah. The earliest is probably Psalms 80 A supplication for the Isr'litish people at the time of the Syrian oppression. All these psalms", "80-83", "are referred by their superscriptions to the Levite singers, and thus beer witness to the efforts of the Levites to reconcile the two branches of the chosen nation. The captivity of Manasseh himself proved to be but temporary; but the sentence which his sins had provoked upon Judah and Jerusalem still remained to be executed, and precluded the hope that God's salvation could be revealed till after such an outpouring of his judgments as the nation had never yet known. Labor and sorrow must be the lot of the present generation; through these mercy might occasionally gleam, but the glory which was eventually to be manifested must be for posterity alone. The psalms of Book IV.", "bear generally the impress of this feeling. We pass to Book V. Psalms 107 is the opening psalm of the return, sung probably at the first feast of tabernacles. Ezra 3 A directly historical character belongs to Psalms 120-134, styled in our Authorized Version \"Songs of Degrees.\" Internal evidence refers these to the period when the Jews under Nehemiah were, in the very face of the enemy, repairing the walls of Jerusalem and the title may well signify \"songs of goings up upon the walls,\" the psalms being from their brevity, well adapted to be sung by the workmen and guards while engaged in their respective duties. Psalms 139 is a psalm of the new birth of Isr'l from the womb of the Babylonish captivity, to a life of righteousness; Psalms 140-143 may be a picture of the trials to which the unrestored exiles were still exposed in the realms of the Gentiles. Henceforward, as we approach the close of the Psalter, its strains rise in cheerfulness; and it fittingly terminates with Psalms 147-150 which were probably sung on the occasion of the thanksgiving procession of Nehe 12, after the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem had been completed.  Moral characteristics of the Psalms  .", "Foremost among these meets us, undoubtedly, the universal recourse to communion with God. Connected with this is the faith by which the psalmist everywhere lives in God rather than in himself. It is of the essence of such faith that his view of the perfections of God should be true and vivid. The Psalter describes God as he is: it glows with testimonies to his power and providence, his love and faithfulness, his holiness and righteousness. The Psalms not only set forth the perfections of God; they proclaim also the duty of worshipping him by the acknowledgment and adoration of his perfections. They encourage all outward rites and means of worship. Among these they recognize the ordinance of sacrifice as in expression of the worshipper's consecration of himself to God's service. But not the less do they repudiate the outward rite when separated from that which it was designed to express. Similar depth is observable in the view taken by the psalmists of human sin. In regard to the law, the psalmist, while warmly acknowledging its excellence, feels yet that it cannot so effectually guide his own unassisted exertions as to preserve him from error Psalms 19. The Psalms bear repeated testimony to the duty of instructing other in the ways of holiness. Psalms 32,34, 51 This brings us to notice, lastly, the faith of the psalmists in righteous recompense to all men according to their deeds. Psalms 37, etc.  Prophetical character of the Psalms  .", "The moral struggle between godliness and ungodliness, so vividly depicted in the Psalms, culminates in Holy Scripture, in the life of the Incarnate Son of God upon earth. It only remains to show that the Psalms themselves definitely anticipated this culmination. Now there are in the Psalter at least three psalms of which the interest evidently centers in a person distinct from the speaker, and which, since they cannot without violence to the language be interpreted of any but the Messiah, may be termed directly and exclusively Messianic. We refer to Psalms 2,45,110, to which may perhaps be added, Psalms 72. It would be strange if these few psalms stood, in their prophetical significance absolutely alone among the rest. And hence the impossibility of viewing the psalms generally, notwithstanding the drapery in which they are outwardly clothed, as simply the past devotions of the historical David or the historical Isr'l. The national hymns of Isr'l are indeed also prospective; but in general they anticipate rather the struggles and the triumphs of the Christian Church than those of Christ himself."], "Word": "Psalms, Book of", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}}}

Psalms 45:1 ). This Hebrew word is the first and the most generally used for a prophet. In the time of Samuel another word, ro'eh, \"seer\", began to be used ( 1 Samuel 9:9 ). It occurs seven times in reference to Samuel. Afterwards another word, hozeh, \"seer\" ( 2 Samuel 24:11 ), was employed. In  1 Chronicles 29:29  all these three words are used- \"Samuel the seer (ro'eh), Nathan the prophet (nabi'), Gad the seer\" (hozeh). In  Joshua 13:22  Balaam is called (Heb.) a kosem \"diviner,\" a word used only of a false prophet.", "The \"prophet\" proclaimed the message given to him, as the \"seer\" beheld the vision of God. (See  Numbers 12:6, 8 .) Thus a prophet was a spokesman for God; he spake in God's name and by his authority ( Exodus 7:1 ). He is the mouth by which God speaks to men ( Jeremiah 1:9 ;  Isaiah 51:16 ), and hence what the prophet says is not of man but of God ( 2 Peter 1:20, 21 ; comp.  Hebrews 3:7 ;  Acts 4:25 ;  28:25 ). Prophets were the immediate organs of God for the communication of his mind and will to men ( Deuteronomy 18:18, 19 ). The whole Word of God may in this general sense be spoken of as prophetic, inasmuch as it was written by men who received the revelation they communicated from God, no matter what its nature might be. The foretelling of future events was not a necessary but only an incidental part of the prophetic office. The great task assigned to the prophets whom God raised up among the people was \"to correct moral and religious abuses, to proclaim the great moral and religious truths which are connected with the character of God, and which lie at the foundation of his government.\"", "Any one being a spokesman for God to man might thus be called a prophet. Thus Enoch, Abraham, and the patriarchs, as bearers of God's message ( Genesis 20:7 ;  Exodus 7:1 ;  Psalms 105:15 ), as also Moses ( Deuteronomy 18:15 ;  34:10 ;  Hosea 12:13 ), are ranked among the prophets. The seventy elders of Israel ( Numbers 11:16-29 ), \"when the spirit rested upon them, prophesied;\" Asaph and Jeduthun \"prophesied with a harp\" ( 1 Chronicles 25:3 ). Miriam and Deborah were prophetesses ( Exodus 15:20 ;  Judges 4:4 ). The title thus has a general application to all who have messages from God to men.", "But while the prophetic gift was thus exercised from the beginning, the prophetical order as such began with Samuel. Colleges, \"schools of the prophets\", were instituted for the training of prophets, who were constituted, a distinct order ( 1 Samuel 19:18-24 ;  2 Kings 2:3, 15 ;  4:38 ), which continued to the close of the Old Testament. Such \"schools\" were established at Ramah, Bethel, Gilgal, Gibeah, and Jericho. The \"sons\" or \"disciples\" of the prophets were young men ( 2 Kings 5:22 ;  9:1, 4 ) who lived together at these different \"schools\" ( 4:38-41 ). These young men were taught not only the rudiments of secular knowledge, but they were brought up to exercise the office of prophet, \"to preach pure morality and the heart-felt worship of Jehovah, and to act along and co-ordinately with the priesthood and monarchy in guiding the state aright and checking all attempts at illegality and tyranny.\"", "In New Testament times the prophetical office was continued. Our Lord is frequently spoken of as a prophet ( Luke 13:33 ;  24:19 ). He was and is the great Prophet of the Church. There was also in the Church a distinct order of prophets ( 1 Corinthians 12:28 ;  Ephesians 2:20 ;  3:5 ), who made new revelations from God. They differed from the \"teacher,\" whose office it was to impart truths already revealed.", "Of the Old Testament prophets there are sixteen, whose prophecies form part of the inspired canon. These are divided into four groups-", "1.  The prophets of the northern kingdom (Israel), viz., Hosea, Amos, Joel, Jonah.", "2.  The prophets of Judah, viz., Isaiah, Jeremiah, Obadiah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah.", "3.  The prophets of Captivity, viz., Ezekiel and Daniel.", "4.  The prophets of the Restoration, viz., Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi."], "Word": "Prophet", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "2": {"Definitions": ["The ordinary Hebrew word for prophet is  nabi  , derived from a verb signifying \"to bubble forth\" like a fountain; hence the word means one who  announces  or  pours forth  the declarations of God. The English word comes from the Greek prophetes ( profetes ), which signifies in classical Greek  one who speaks for another  , especially  one who speaks for a god  , and so interprets his will to man; hence its essential meaning is \"an interpreter.\" The use of the word in its modern sense as \"one who predicts\" is post-classical. The larger sense of  interpretation  has not, however, been lost. In fact the English word ways been used in a closer sense. The different meanings or shades of meanings in which the abstract noun is employed in Scripture have been drawn out by Locke as follows: \"Prophecy comprehends three things: prediction; singing by the dictate of the Spirit; and understanding and explaining the mysterious, hidden sense of Scripture by an immediate illumination and motion of the Spirit.\"  Order and office  .", "The sacerdotal order was originally the instrument by which the members of the Jewish theocracy were taught and governed in things spiritual. Teaching by act and teaching by word were alike their task. But during the time of the judges, the priesthood sank into a state of degeneracy, and the people were no longer affected by the acted lessons of the ceremonial service. They required less enigmatic warnings and exhortations, under these circumstances a new moral power was evoked the Prophetic Order. Samuel himself Levite of the family of Kohath, ( 1 Chronicles 6:28 ) and almost certainly a priest, was the instrument used at once for effecting a reform in the sacerdotal order ( 1 Chronicles 9:22 ) and for giving to the prophets a position of importance which they had never before held. Nevertheless it is not to be supposed that Samuel created the prophetic order as a new thing before unknown. The germs both of the prophetic and of the regal order are found in the law as given to the Isr'lites by Moses, ( 13:1 ;  18:20 ;  17:18 ) but they were not yet developed, because there was not yet the demand for them. Samuel took measures to make his work of restoration permanent as well as effective for the moment. For this purpose he instituted companies or colleges of prophets. One we find in his lifetime at Ramah, ( 1 Samuel 19:19,20 ) others afterward at Bethel, ( 2 Kings 2:3 ) Jericho, ( 2 Kings 2:2,5 ) Gilgal; ( 2 Kings 4:38 ) and elsewhere. ( 2 Kings 6:1 ) Their constitution and object similar to those of theological colleges. Into them were gathered promising students, and here they were trained for the office which they were afterward destined to fulfill. So successful were these institutions that from the time of Samuel to the closing of the canon of the Old Testament there seems never to have been wanting due supply of men to keep up the line of official prophets. Their chief subject of study was, no doubt, the law and its interpretation; oral, as distinct from symbolical, teaching being thenceforward tacitly transferred from the priestly to the prophetic order. Subsidiary subjects of instruction were music and sacred poetry, both of which had been connected with prophecy from the time of Moses ( Exodus 15:20 ) and the judges. ( Judges 4:4 ;  5:1 ) But to belong to the prophetic order and to possess the prophetic gift are not convertible terms. Generally, the inspired prophet came from the college of prophets, and belonged to prophetic order; but this was not always the case. Thus Amos though called to the prophetic  office  did not belong to the prophetic order. ( Amos 7:14 ) The sixteen prophets whose books are in the canon have that place of honor because they were endowed with the prophetic gift us well as ordinarily (so far as we know) belonging to the prophetic order.

(See  EGYPT .) The name is a compound, as some think, of the words Ra, the \"sun\" or \"sun-god,\" and the article phe, \"the,\" prefixed; hence phera, \"the sun,\" or \"the sun-god.\" But others, perhaps more correctly, think the name derived from Perao, \"the great house\" = his majesty = in Turkish, \"the Sublime Porte.\"", "1.  The Pharaoh who was on the throne when Abram went down into Egypt ( Genesis 12:10-20 ) was probably one of the Hyksos, or \"shepherd kings.\" The Egyptians called the nomad tribes of Syria Shasu, \"plunderers,\" their king or chief Hyk, and hence the name of those invaders who conquered the native kings and established a strong government, with Zoan or Tanis as their capital. They were of Semitic origin, and of kindred blood accordingly with Abram. They were probably driven forward by the pressure of the Hittites. The name they bear on the monuments is \"Mentiu.\"", "2.  The Pharaoh of Joseph's days (Genesis 41) was probably Apopi, or Apopis, the last of the Hyksos kings. To the old native Egyptians, who were an African race, shepherds were \"an abomination;\" but to the Hyksos kings these Asiatic shepherds who now appeared with Jacob at their head were congenial, and being akin to their own race, had a warm welcome ( Genesis 47:5, 6 ). Some argue that Joseph came to Egypt in the reign of Thothmes III., long after the expulsion of the Hyksos, and that his influence is to be seen in the rise and progress of the religious revolution in the direction of monotheism which characterized the middle of the Eighteenth Dynasty. The wife of Amenophis III., of that dynasty, was a Semite. Is this singular fact to be explained from the presence of some of Joseph's kindred at the Egyptian court? Pharaoh said to Joseph, \"Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee: the land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell\" ( Genesis 47:5, 6 ).", "3.  The \"new king who knew not Joseph\" ( Exodus 1:8-22 ) has been generally supposed to have been Aahmes I., or Amosis, as he is called by Josephus. Recent discoveries, however, have led to the conclusion that Seti was the \"new king.\"", "For about seventy years the Hebrews in Egypt were under the powerful protection of Joseph. After his death their condition was probably very slowly and gradually changed. The invaders, the Hyksos, who for some five centuries had been masters of Egypt, were driven out, and the old dynasty restored. The Israelites now began to be looked down upon. They began to be afflicted and tyrannized over. In process of time a change appears to have taken place in the government of Egypt. A new dynasty, the Nineteenth, as it is called, came into power under Seti I., who was its founder. He associated with him in his government his son, Rameses II., when he was yet young, probably ten or twelve years of age.", "Note, Professor Maspero, keeper of the museum of Bulak, near Cairo, had his attention in 1870 directed to the fact that scarabs, i.e., stone and metal imitations of the beetle (symbols of immortality), originally worn as amulets by royal personages, which were evidently genuine relics of the time of the ancient Pharaohs, were being sold at Thebes and different places along the Nile. This led him to suspect that some hitherto undiscovered burial-place of the Pharaohs had been opened, and that these and other relics, now secretly sold, were a part of the treasure found there. For a long time he failed, with all his ingenuity, to find the source of these rare treasures. At length one of those in the secret volunteered to give information regarding this burial-place. The result was that a party was conducted in 1881 to Dier el-Bahari, near Thebes, when the wonderful discovery was made of thirty-six mummies of kings, queens, princes, and high priests hidden away in a cavern prepared for them, where they had lain undisturbed for thirty centuries. \"The temple of Deir el-Bahari stands in the middle of a natural amphitheatre of cliffs, which is only one of a number of smaller amphitheatres into which the limestone mountains of the tombs are broken up. In the wall of rock separating this basin from the one next to it some ancient Egyptian engineers had constructed the hiding-place, whose secret had been kept for nearly three thousand years.\" The exploring party being guided to the place, found behind a great rock a shaft 6 feet square and about 40 feet deep, sunk into the limestone. At the bottom of this a passage led westward for 25 feet, and then turned sharply northward into the very heart of the mountain, where in a chamber 23 feet by 13, and 6 feet in height, they came upon the wonderful treasures of antiquity. The mummies were all carefully secured and brought down to Bulak, where they were deposited in the royal museum, which has now been removed to Ghizeh.", "Among the most notable of the ancient kings of Egypt thus discovered were Thothmes III., Seti I., and Rameses II. Thothmes III. was the most distinguished monarch of the brilliant Eighteenth Dynasty. When this mummy was unwound \"once more, after an interval of thirty-six centuries, human eyes gazed on the features of the man who had conquered Syria and Cyprus and Ethiopia, and had raised Egypt to the highest pinnacle of her power. The spectacle, however, was of brief duration. The remains proved to be in so fragile a state that there was only time to take a hasty photograph, and then the features crumbled to pieces and vanished like an apparition, and so passed away from human view for ever.\" \"It seems strange that though the body of this man,\" who overran Palestine with his armies two hundred years before the birth of Moses, \"mouldered to dust, the flowers with which it had been wreathed were so wonderfully preserved that even their colour could be distinguished\" (Manning's Land of the Pharaohs).", "Seti I. (his throne name Merenptah), the father of Rameses II., was a great and successful warrior, also a great builder. The mummy of this Pharaoh, when unrolled, brought to view \"the most beautiful mummy head ever seen within the walls of the museum. The sculptors of Thebes and Abydos did not flatter this Pharaoh when they gave him that delicate, sweet, and smiling profile which is the admiration of travellers. After a lapse of thirty-two centuries, the mummy retains the same expression which characterized the features of the living man. Most remarkable of all, when compared with the mummy of Rameses II., is the striking resemblance between the father and the son. Seti I. is, as it were, the idealized type of Rameses II. He must have died at an advanced age. The head is shaven, the eyebrows are white, the condition of the body points to considerably more than threescore years of life, thus confirming the opinions of the learned, who have attributed a long reign to this king.\"", "4.  Rameses II., the son of Seti I., is probably the Pharaoh of the Oppression. During his forty years' residence at the court of Egypt, Moses must have known this ruler well. During his sojourn in Midian, however, Rameses died, after a reign of sixty-seven years, and his body embalmed and laid in the royal sepulchre in the Valley of the Tombs of Kings beside that of his father. Like the other mummies found hidden in the cave of Deir el-Bahari, it had been for some reason removed from its original tomb, and probably carried from place to place till finally deposited in the cave where it was so recently discovered.", "In 1886, the mummy of this king, the \"great Rameses,\" the \"Sesostris\" of the Greeks, was unwound, and showed the body of what must have been a robust old man. The features revealed to view are thus described by Maspero: \"The head is long and small in proportion to the body. The top of the skull is quite bare. On the temple there are a few sparse hairs, but at the poll the hair is quite thick, forming smooth, straight locks about two inches in length. White at the time of death, they have been dyed a light yellow by the spices used in embalmment. The forehead is low and narrow; the brow-ridge prominent; the eye-brows are thick and white; the eyes are small and close together; the nose is long, thin, arched like the noses of the Bourbons; the temples are sunk; the cheek-bones very prominent; the ears round, standing far out from the head, and pierced, like those of a woman, for the wearing of earrings; the jaw-bone is massive and strong; the chin very prominent; the mouth small, but thick-lipped; the teeth worn and very brittle, but white and well preserved. The moustache and beard are thin. They seem to have been kept shaven during life, but were probably allowed to grow during the king's last illness, or they may have grown after death. The hairs are white, like those of the head and eyebrows, but are harsh and bristly, and a tenth of an inch in length. The skin is of an earthy-brown, streaked with black. Finally, it may be said, the face of the mummy gives a fair idea of the face of the living king. The expression is unintellectual, perhaps slightly animal; but even under the somewhat grotesque disguise of mummification there is plainly to be seen an air of sovereign majesty, of resolve, and of pride.\"", "Both on his father's and his mother's side it has been pretty clearly shown that Rameses had Chaldean or Mesopotamian blood in his veins to such a degree that he might be called an Assyrian. This fact is thought to throw light on  Isaiah 52:4 .", "5.  The Pharaoh of the Exodus was probably Menephtah I., the fourteenth and eldest surviving son of Rameses II. He resided at Zoan, where he had the various interviews with Moses and Aaron recorded in the book of Exodus. His mummy was not among those found at Deir el-Bahari. It is still a question, however, whether Seti II. or his father Menephtah was the Pharaoh of the Exodus. Some think the balance of evidence to be in favour of the former, whose reign it is known began peacefully, but came to a sudden and disastrous end. The \"Harris papyrus,\" found at Medinet-Abou in Upper Egypt in 1856, a state document written by Rameses III., the second king of the Twentieth Dynasty, gives at length an account of a great exodus from Egypt, followed by wide-spread confusion and anarchy. This, there is great reason to believe, was the Hebrew exodus, with which the Nineteenth Dynasty of the Pharaohs came to an end. This period of anarchy was brought to a close by Setnekht, the founder of the Twentieth Dynasty.", "\"In the spring of 1896, Professor Flinders Petrie discovered, among the ruins of the temple of Menephtah at Thebes, a large granite stela, on which is engraved a hymn of victory commemorating the defeat of Libyan invaders who had overrun the Delta. At the end other victories of Menephtah are glanced at, and it is said that the Israelites (I-s-y-r-a-e-l-u) are minished (?) so that they have no seed.' Menephtah was son and successor of Rameses II., the builder of Pithom, and Egyptian scholars have long seen in him the Pharaoh of the Exodus. The Exodus is also placed in his reign by the Egyptian legend of the event preserved by the historian Manetho. In the inscription the name of the Israelites has no determinative of country' or 'district' attached to it, as is the case with all the other names (Canaan, Ashkelon, Gezer, Khar or Southern Palestine, etc.) mentioned along with it, and it would therefore appear that at the time the hymn was composed, the Israelites had already been lost to the sight of the Egyptians in the desert. At all events they must have had as yet no fixed home or district of their own. We may therefore see in the reference to them the Pharaoh's version of the Exodus, the disasters which befell the Egyptians being naturally passed over in silence, and only the destruction of the men children' of the Israelites being recorded. The statement of the Egyptian poet is a remarkable parallel to  Exodus 1:10-22 .\"", "6.  The Pharaoh of  1 Kings 11:18-22 .", "7.  So, king of Egypt ( 2 Kings 17:4 ).", "8.

They were a branch of the primitive race which spread over the whole district of the Lebanon and the valley of the Jordan, and Crete and other Mediterranean islands. Some suppose them to have been a branch of the Rephaim ( 2 Samuel 21:16-22 ). In the time of Abraham they inhabited the south-west of Judea, Abimelech of Gerar being their king ( Genesis 21:32, 34 ;  26:1 ). They are, however, not noticed among the Canaanitish tribes mentioned in the Pentateuch. They are spoken of by Amos ( 9:7 ) and Jeremiah ( 47:4 ) as from Caphtor, i.e., probably Crete, or, as some think, the Delta of Egypt. In the whole record from Exodus to Samuel they are represented as inhabiting the tract of country which lay between Judea and Egypt ( Exodus 13:17 ;  15:14, 15 ;  Joshua 13:3 ; 1 Samuel 4).", "This powerful tribe made frequent incursions against the Hebrews. There was almost perpetual war between them. They sometimes held the tribes, especially the southern tribes, in degrading servitude ( Judges 15:11 ;  1 Samuel 13:19-22 ); at other times they were defeated with great slaughter ( 1 Samuel 14:1-47 ; 17). These hostilities did not cease till the time of Hezekiah ( 2 Kings 18:8 ), when they were entirely subdued. They still, however, occupied their territory, and always showed their old hatred to Israel ( Ezekiel 25:15-17 ). They were finally conquered by the Romans.", "The Philistines are called Pulsata or Pulista on the Egyptian monuments; the land of the Philistines (Philistia) being termed Palastu and Pilista in the Assyrian inscriptions. They occupied the five cities of Gaza, Ashkelon, Ashdod, Ekron, and Gath, in the south-western corner of Canaan, which belonged to Egypt up to the closing days of the Nineteenth Dynasty. The occupation took place during the reign of Rameses III. of the Twentieth Dynasty. The Philistines had formed part of the great naval confederacy which attacked Egypt, but were eventually repulsed by that Pharaoh, who, however, could not dislodge them from their settlements in Palestine. As they did not enter Palestine till the time of the Exodus, the use of the name Philistines in  Genesis 26:1  must be proleptic. Indeed the country was properly Gerar, as in ch. 20.", "They are called Allophyli, \"foreigners,\" in the Septuagint, and in the Books of Samuel they are spoken of as uncircumcised. It would therefore appear that they were not of the Semitic race, though after their establishment in Canaan they adopted the Semitic language of the country. We learn from the Old Testament that they came from Caphtor, usually supposed to be Crete.

( Genesis 10:14 ) It has been generally assumed that Caphtor represents Crete, and that the Philistines migrated from that island, either directly or through Egypt, into Palestine. But the name Caphtor is more probably identified with the Egyptian Coptos. [ CAPHTOR, CAPHTORIM ]  History.", "The Philistines must have settled in the land of Canaan before the time of Abraham; for they are noticed in his day as a pastoral tribe in the neighborhood of Gerur. ( Genesis 21:32,34 ;  26:1,8 ) Between the times of Abraham and Joshua the Philistines had changed their quarters, and had advanced northward into the plain of Philistia. The Philistines had at an early period attained proficiency in the arts of peace. Their wealth was abundant, ( Judges 16:5,19 ) and they appear in all respects to have been a prosperous people. Possessed of such elements of power, they had attained in the time of the judges an important position among eastern nations. About B.C. 1200 we find them engaged in successful war with the Sidonians. Justin xviii. 3. The territory of the Philistines having been once occupied by the Canaanites, formed a portion of the promised land, and was assigned the tribe of Judah. ( Joshua 15:2,12,45-47 ) No portion of it, however, was conquered in the lifetime of Joshua, ( Joshua 13:2 ) and even after his death no permanent conquest was effected, ( Judges 3:3 ) though we are informed that the three cities of Gaza, Ashkelon and Ekron were taken. ( Judges 1:18 ) The Philistines soon recovered these, and commenced an aggressive policy against the Isr'lites, by which they gained a complete ascendancy over them. Individual heroes were raised up from time to time, such as Shamgar the son of Anath, ( Judges 3:31 ) and still more Samson, Judges 13-16, but neither of these men succeeded in permanently throwing off the yoke. The Isr'lites attributed their past weakness to their want, of unity, and they desired a king, with the special object of leading them against the foe. ( 1 Samuel 8:20 ) Saul threw off the yoke; and the Philistines were defeated with great slaughter at Geba. ( 1 Samuel 13:3 ) They made no attempt to regain their supremacy for about twenty-five years, and the scene of the next contest shows the altered strength of the two parties. It was no longer in the central country, but in a ravine leading down to the Philistine plain, the valley of Elah, the position of which is about 14 miles southwest of Jerusalem. On this occasion the prowess of young David secured success to Isr'l, and the foe was pursued to the gates of Gath and Ekron. ( 1 Samuel 17:1 ) ... The power of the Philistines was, however, still intact on their own territory. The border warfare was continued. The scene of the next conflict was far to the north, in the valley of Esdr'lon. The battle on this occasion proved disastrous to the Isr'lites; Saul himself perished, and the Philistines penetrated across the Jordan and occupied the, forsaken cities. ( 1 Samuel 31:1-7 ) On the appointment of David to be king, he twice attacked them, and on each occasion with signal success, in the first case capturing their images, in the second pursuing them \"from Geba until thou come to Gazer.\" ( 2 Samuel 5:17-25 ;  1 Chronicles 14:8-16 ) Henceforth the Isr'lites appear as the aggressors. About seven years after the defeat at Rephaim, David, who had now consolidated his power, attacked them on their own soil end took Gath with its dependencies. The whole of Philistine was included in Solomon's empire. Later when the Philistines, joined by the Syrians and Assyrians, made war on the kingdom of Isr'l, Hezekiah formed an alliance with the Egyptians, as a counterpoise to the Assyrians, and the possession of Philistia became henceforth the turning-point of the struggle between the two great empires of the East. The Assyrians under Tartan, the general of Sargon, made an expedition against Egypt, and took Ashdod, as the key of that country. ( Isaiah 20:1,4,5 ) Under Senacherib, Philistia was again the scene of important operations. The Assyrian supremacy was restored by Esarhaddon, and it seems probable that the Assyrians retained their hold on Ashdod until its capture, after a long siege, by Psammetichus. It was about this time that Philistia was traversed by vast Scythian horde on their way to Egypt. The Egyptian ascendancy was not as yet re-established, for we find the next king, Necho, compelled to besiege Gaza on his return from the battle of Megiddo. After the death of Necho the contest was renewed between the Egyptians and the Chaldeans under Nebuchadnezzar, and the result was specially disastrous to the Philistines. The \"old hatred\" that the Philistines bore to the Jews was exhibited in acts of hostility at the time of the Babylonish captivity, ( Ezekiel 25:15-17 ) but on the return this was somewhat abated, for some of the Jews married Philistine women, to the great scandal of their rulers. ( Nehemiah 13:23,24 ) From this time the history of Philistia is absorbed in the struggles of the neighboring kingdoms. The latest notices of the Philistines as a nation occur in 1 Macc. 3-5.  Institutions, religion, etc  .", "With regard to the institutions of the Philistines our information is very scanty, The five chief cities had, as early as the days of Joshua, constituted themselves into a confederacy, restricted however, in all probability, to matters of offence and defence. Each was under the government of a prince, ( Joshua 13:3 ;  Judges 3:3 ) etc.; ( 1 Samuel 18:30 ;  29:6 ) and each possessed its own territory. The Philistines appear to have been deeply imbued with superstition- they carried their idols with them on their campaigns, ( 2 Samuel 5:21 ) and proclaimed their victories in their presence. ( 1 Samuel 31:9 ) The gods whom they chiefly worshipped were Dagon, ( Judges 16:23 ;  1 Samuel 5:3-5 ;  1 Chronicles 10:10 ) 1Macc. 10.83, Ashtaroth, ( 1 Samuel 31:10 ) Herod. I. 105, and Baalzebub.

Ablution of the person and of the clothes was required in the cases mentioned in ( Leviticus 15:18 ;  11:25,40 ;  15:18,17 ) In cases of childbirth the sacrifice was increased to a lamb of the first year, with a pigeon or turtle-dove.

The purification of the leper was a yet more formal proceeding, and indicated the highest pitch of uncleanness.

Cups and pots and brazen vessels were washed as a matter of ritual observance. ( Mark 7:4 ) The washing of the hands before meals was conducted in a formal manner.

He himself explains his reasons for this in his answer to the inquiry of the disciples, \"Why speakest thou to them in parables?\" ( Matthew 13:13-15 ;  Mark 4:11, 12 ;  Luke 8:9, 10 ).

Of this sort were the parables of Christ. The parable differs from the fable (1) in excluding brute and inanimate creatures passing out of the laws of their nature and speaking or acting like men; (2) in its higher ethical significance. It differs from the allegory in that the latter, with its direct personification of ideas or attributes, and the names which designate them, involves really no comparison. The virtues and vices of mankind appear as in a drama, in their own character and costume. The allegory is self-interpreting; the parable demands attention, insight, sometimes an actual explanation. It differs from a proverb in that it must include a similitude of some kind, while the proverb may assert, without a similitude, some wide generalization of experience.", "ED.) For some months Jesus taught in the synagogues and on the seashore of Galilee as he had before taught in Jerusalem, and as yet without a parable. But then there came a change. The direct teaching was met with scorn unbelief hardness, and he seemed for a time to abandon it for that which took the form of parables. The worth of parables as instruments of teaching lies in their being at once a test of character and in their presenting each form of character with that which, as a penalty or blessing, is adapted to it. They withdraw the light from those who love darkness. They protect the truth which they enshrine from the mockery of the scoffer. They leave something even with the careless which may be interpreted and understood afterward. They reveal on the other hand, the seekers after truth.

In the New Testament, (1) a proverb ( Mark 7:17 ;  Luke 4:23 ), (2) a typical emblem ( Hebrews 9:9 ;  11:19 ), (3) a similitude or allegory ( Matthew 15:15 ;  24:32 ;  Mark 3:23 ;  Luke 5:36 ;  14:7 ); (4) ordinarily, in a more restricted sense, a comparison of earthly with heavenly things, \"an earthly story with a heavenly meaning,\" as in the parables of our Lord.", "Instruction by parables has been in use from the earliest times. A large portion of our Lord's public teaching consisted of parables. He himself explains his reasons for this in his answer to the inquiry of the disciples, \"Why speakest thou to them in parables?\" ( Matthew 13:13-15 ;  Mark 4:11, 12 ;  Luke 8:9, 10 ). He followed in so doing the rule of the divine procedures, as recorded in  Matthew 13:13 .", "The parables uttered by our Lord are all recorded in the synoptical (i.e., the first three) Gospels. The fourth Gospel contains no parable properly so called, although the illustration of the good shepherd ( John 10:1-16 ) has all the essential features of a parable. (See also List of Parables in Appendix.)"], "Word": "Parable", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "2": {"Definitions": ["(The word parable is in Greek parable ( parabole ) which signifies placing beside or together, a comparison, a parable is therefore literally a placing beside, a comparison, a similitude, an illustration of one subject by another.", "McClintock and Strong. As used in the New Testament it had a very wide application, being applied sometimes to the shortest proverbs, ( 1 Samuel 10:12 ;  24:13 ;  2 Chronicles 7:20 ) sometimes to dark prophetic utterances, ( Numbers 23:7,18 ;  24:3 ;  Ezekiel 20:49 ) sometimes to enigmatic maxims, ( Psalms 78:2 ;  Proverbs 1:6 ) or metaphors expanded into a narrative. ( Ezekiel 12:22 ) In the New Testament itself the word is used with a like latitude in ( Matthew 24:32 ;  Luke 4:23 ;  Hebrews 9:9 ) It was often used in a more restricted sense to denote a short narrative under which some important truth is veiled. Of this sort were the parables of Christ. The parable differs from the fable (1) in excluding brute and inanimate creatures passing out of the laws of their nature and speaking or acting like men; (2) in its higher ethical significance. It differs from the allegory in that the latter, with its direct personification of ideas or attributes, and the names which designate them, involves really no comparison. The virtues and vices of mankind appear as in a drama, in their own character and costume. The allegory is self-interpreting; the parable demands attention, insight, sometimes an actual explanation. It differs from a proverb in that it must include a similitude of some kind, while the proverb may assert, without a similitude, some wide generalization of experience.", "ED.) For some months Jesus taught in the synagogues and on the seashore of Galilee as he had before taught in Jerusalem, and as yet without a parable. But then there came a change. The direct teaching was met with scorn unbelief hardness, and he seemed for a time to abandon it for that which took the form of parables. The worth of parables as instruments of teaching lies in their being at once a test of character and in their presenting each form of character with that which, as a penalty or blessing, is adapted to it. They withdraw the light from those who love darkness. They protect the truth which they enshrine from the mockery of the scoffer. They leave something even with the careless which may be interpreted and understood afterward. They reveal on the other hand, the seekers after truth. These ask the meaning of the parable, and will not rest until the teacher has explained it. In this way the parable did work, found out the fit hearers and led them on.

The appearance of Jerusalem on the occasion of the Passover in the time of our Lord is thus fittingly described- \"The city itself and the neighbourhood became more and more crowded as the feast approached, the narrow streets and dark arched bazaars showing the same throng of men of all nations as when Jesus had first visited Jerusalem as a boy. Even the temple offered a strange sight at this season, for in parts of the outer courts a wide space was covered with pens for sheep, goats, and cattle to be used for offerings. Sellers shouted the merits of their beasts, sheep bleated, oxen lowed. Sellers of doves also had a place set apart for them. Potters offered a choice from huge stacks of clay dishes and ovens for roasting and eating the Passover lamb. Booths for wine, oil, salt, and all else needed for sacrifices invited customers. Persons going to and from the city shortened their journey by crossing the temple grounds, often carrying burdens...Stalls to change foreign money into the shekel of the temple, which alone could be paid to the priests, were numerous, the whole confusion making the sanctuary like a noisy market\" (Geikie's Life of Christ)."], "Word": "Passover", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "37": {"Definitions": ["Institution of Exodus 12:3-49 ;  Exodus 23:15-18 ;  Exodus 34:18 ;  Leviticus 23:4-8 ;  Numbers 9:2-5 ;  Numbers 9:13-14 ;  Numbers 28:16-25 ;  Deuteronomy 16:1-8 ;  Deuteronomy 16:16 ;  Psalms 81:3 ;  Psalms 81:5", "Design of Exodus 12:21-28", "Special Passover, for those who were unclean, or on journey, to be held in second month Numbers 9:6-12 ;  2 Chronicles 30:2-4", "Lamb killed by Levites, for those who were ceremonially unclean 2 Chronicles 30:17 ;  2 Chronicles 35:3-11 ;  Ezra 6:20", "Strangers authorized to celebrate Exodus 12:48-49 ;  Numbers 9:14", "Observed:", "At place designated by God Deuteronomy 16:5-7", "With unleavened bread Exodus 12:8 ;  Exodus 12:15-20 ;  Exodus 13:3 ;  Exodus 13:6 ;  Exodus 23:15 ;  Leviticus 23:6 ;  Numbers 9:11 ;  Numbers 28:17 ;  Deuteronomy 16:3-4 ;  Mark 14:12 ;  Luke 22:7 ;  Acts 12:3 ;  1 Corinthians 5:8", "Penalty for neglecting to observe Numbers 9:13", "Reinstituted by Ezekiel Ezekiel 45:21-24", "Observation of:", "Renewed by the Israelites on entering Canaan Joshua 5:10-11", "By Hezekiah 2 Chronicles 30:1", "By Josiah 2 Kings 23:22-23 ;  2 Chronicles 35:1 ;  2 Chronicles 35:18", "After return from captivity Ezra 6:19-20", "By Jesus Matthew 26:17-20 ;  Luke 22:15 ;  John 2:13 ;  John 2:23 ;  John 43:13", "Jesus in the temple at time of Luke 2:41-50", "Jesus crucified at time of Matthew 26:2 ;  Mark 14:1-2 ;  John 18:28", "The lamb of, a type of Christ 1 Corinthians 5:7", "Lord's supper ordained at Matthew 26:26-28 ;  Mark 14:12-25 ;  Luke 22:7-20", "Prisoner released at, by the Romans Matthew 27:15 ;  Mark 15:6 ;  Luke 23:16-17 ;  John 18:39", "Peter imprisoned at time of Acts 12:3", "Christ called our Passover 1 Corinthians 5:7 Feasts"], "Word": "Passover", "Dictionary": "Naves Topical Index"}, "38": {"Definitions": ["the first of the three great annual festivals of the Isr'lites celebrated in the month Nisan (March-April, from the 14th to the 21st. (Strictly speaking the Passover only applied to the paschal supper and the feast of unleavened bread followed, which was celebrated to the 21st.) (For the corresponding dates in our month, see  Jewish calendar  at the end of this volume.) The following are the principal passages in the Pentateuch relating to the Passover: ( Exodus 12:1-51 ;  13:3-10 ;  23:14-19 ;  34:18-26 ;  Leviticus 23:4-14 ;  Numbers 9:1-14 ;  28:16-25 ;  16:1-6 )  Why instituted  .", "This feast was instituted by God to commemorate the deliverance of the Isr'lites from Egyptian bondage and the sparing of their firstborn when the destroying angel smote the first-born of the Egyptians. The deliverance from Egypt was regarded as the starting-point of the Hebrew nation. The Isr'lites were then raised from the condition of bondmen under a foreign tyrant to that of a free people owing allegiance to no one but Jehovah. The prophet in a later age spoke of the event as  a creation  and  a redemption  of the nation. God declares himself to be \"the Creator of Isr'l.\" The Exodus was thus looked upon as the birth of the nation; the Passover was its annual birthday feast. It was the yearly memorial of the dedication of the people to him who had saved their first-born from the destroyer, in order that they might be made holy to himself.  First celebration of the Passover  .", "On the tenth day of the month, the head of each family was to select from the flock either a lamb or a kid, a male of the first year, without blemish. If his family was too small to eat the whole of the lamb, he was permitted to invite his nearest neighbor to join the party. On the fourteenth day of the month he was to kill his lamb, while the sun was setting. He was then to take blood in a basin and with a sprig of hyssop to sprinkle it on the two side-posts and the lintel of the door of the house. The lamb was then thoroughly roasted, whole. It was expressly forbidden that it should be boiled, or that a bone of it should be broken. Unleavened bread and bitter herbs were to be eaten with the flesh. No male who was uncircumcised was to join the company. Each one was to have his loins girt, to hold a staff in his hand, and to have shoes on his feet. He was to eat in haste, and it would seem that he was to stand during the meal. The number of the party was to be calculated as nearly as possible, so that all the flesh of the lamb might be eaten; but if any portion of it happened to remain, it was to be burned in the morning. No morsel of it was to be carried out of the house. The lambs were selected, on the fourteenth they were slain and the blood sprinkled, and in the following evening, after the fifteenth day of the had commenced the first paschal meal was eaten. At midnight the firstborn of the Egyptians were smitten. The king and his people were now urgent that the Isr'lites should start immediately, and readily bestowed on them supplies for the journey. In such haste did the Isr'lites depart, on that very day, ( Numbers 33:3 ) that they packed up their kneading troughs containing the dough prepared for the morrow's provisions, which was not yet leavened.  Observance of the Passover in later times  .", "As the original institution of the Passover in Egypt preceded the establishment of the priesthood and the regulation of the service of the tabernacle. It necessarily fell short in several particulars of the observance of the festival according to the fully-developed ceremonial law. The head of the family slew the lamb in his own house, not in the holy place; the blood was sprinkled on the doorway, not on the altar. But when the law was perfected, certain particulars were altered in order to assimilate the Passover to the accustomed order of religious service. In the twelfth and thirteenth chapters of Exodus there are not only distinct references to the observance of the festival in future ages (e.g.) ( Exodus 12:2,14,17,24-27,42 ;  13:2,5,8-10 ) but there are several injunctions which were evidently not intended for the first Passover, and which indeed could not possibly have been observed. Besides the private family festival, there were public and national sacrifices offered each of the seven days of unleavened bread. ( Numbers 28:19 ) On the second day also the first-fruits of the barley harvest were offered in the temple. ( Leviticus 23:10 ) In the latter notices of the festival in the books of the law there are particulars added which appear as modifications of the original institution. ( Leviticus 23:10-14 ;  Numbers 28:16-25 ;  16:1-6 ) Hence it is not without reason that the Jewish writers have laid great stress on the distinction between \"the Egyptian Passover\" and \"the perpetual Passover.\"  Mode and order of the paschal meal  .", "All work except that belonging to a few trades connected with daily life was suspended for some hours before the evening of the 14th Nisan. It was not lawful to eat any ordinary food after midday. No male was admitted to the table unless he was circumcised, even if he were of the seed of Isr'l. ( Exodus 12:48 ) It was customary for the number of a party to be not less than ten. When the meal was prepared, the family was placed round the table, the paterfamilias taking a place of honor, probably somewhat raised above the rest. When the party was arranged the first cup of wine was filled, and a blessing was asked by the head of the family on the feast, as well as a special, one on the cup. The bitter herbs were then placed on the table, and a portion of them eaten, either with Or without the sauce. The unleavened bread was handed round next and afterward the lamb was placed on the table in front of the head of the family. The paschal lamb could be legally slain and the blood and fat offered only in the national sanctuary. ( 16:2 ) Before the lamb was eaten the second cup of wine was filled, and the son, in accordance with ( Exodus 12:26 ) asked his father the meaning of the feast. In reply, an account was given of the sufferings of the Isr'lites in Egypt and of their deliverance, with a particular explanation of ( 26:5 ) and the first part of the Hallel (a contraction from  Hallelujah ), Psalms 113, 114, was sung. This being gone through, the lamb was carved and eaten. The third cup of wine was poured out and drunk, and soon afterward the fourth. The second part of the Hallel, Psalms 115 to 118 was then sung. A fifth wine-cup appears to have been occasionally produced, But perhaps only in later times. What was termed the greater Hallel, Psalms 120 to 138 was sung on such occasions. The Isr'lites who lived in the country appear to have been accommodated at the feast by the inhabitants of Jerusalem in their houses, so far its there was room for them. ( Matthew 26:18 ;  Luke 22:10-12 ) Those who could not be received into the city encamped without the walls in tents as the pilgrims now do at Mecca.  The Passover as a type  .", "The Passover was not only commemorative but also typical. \"The deliverance which it commemorated was a type of the great salvation it foretold.\"", "No other shadow of things to come contained in the law can vie with the festival of the Passover in expressiveness and completeness. (1) The paschal lamb must of course be regarded as the leading feature in the ceremonial of the festival. The lamb slain typified Christ the \"Lamb of God.\" slain for the sins of the world. Christ \"our Passover is sacrificed for us.\" ( 1 Corinthians 5:7 ) According to the divine purpose, the true Lamb of God was slain at nearly the same time as \"the Lord's Passover\" at the same season of the year; and at the same time of the day as the daily sacrifice at the temple, the crucifixion beginning at the hour of the morning sacrifice and ending at the hour of the evening sacrifice. That the lamb was to be roasted and not boiled has been supposed to commemorate the haste of the departure of the Isr'lites. It is not difficult to determine the reason of the command \"not a bone of him shall be broken.\" The lamb was to be a symbol of unity", "the unity of the family, the unity of the nation, the unity of God with his people whom he had taken into covenant with himself. (2) The unleavened bread ranks next in importance to the paschal lamb. We are warranted in concluding that unleavened bread had a peculiar sacrificial character, according to the law. It seems more reasonable to accept St, Paul's reference to the subject, ( 1 Corinthians 5:6-8 ) as furnishing the true meaning of the symbol. Fermentation is decomposition, a dissolution of unity. The pure dry biscuit would be an apt emblem of unchanged duration, and, in its freedom from foreign mixture, of purity also. (3) The offering of the omer or first sheaf of the harvest, ( Leviticus 23:10-14 ) signified deliverance from winter the bondage of Egypt being well considered as a winter in the history of the nation. (4) The consecration of the first-fruits, the firstborn of the soil, is an easy type of the consecration of the first born of the Isr'lites, and of our own best selves, to God. Further than this (1) the Passover is a type of deliverance from the slavery of sin. (2) It is the passing over of the doom we deserve for your sins, because the blood of Christ has been applied to us by faith. (3) The sprinkling of the blood upon the door-posts was a symbol of open confession of our allegiance and love. (4) The Passover was useless unless eaten; so we live upon the Lord Jesus Christ. (5) It was eaten with bitter herbs, as we must eat our passover with the bitter herbs of repentance and confession, which yet, like the bitter herbs of the Passover, are a fitting and natural accompaniment. (6) As the Isr'lites ate the Passover all prepared for the journey, so do we with a readiness and desire to enter the active service of Christ, and to go on the journey toward heaven.", "ED.)"], "Word": "Passover", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "39": {"Definitions": ["P'ASSOVER ,  noun   [pass and over.] A feast of the Jews, instituted to commemorate the providential escape of the Hebrews, in Egypt, when God smiting the first-born of the Egyptians, passed over the houses of the Israelites, which were marked with the blood of the paschal lamb.", "1.

They were a branch of the primitive race which spread over the whole district of the Lebanon and the valley of the Jordan, and Crete and other Mediterranean islands. Some suppose them to have been a branch of the Rephaim ( 2 Samuel 21:16-22 ). In the time of Abraham they inhabited the south-west of Judea, Abimelech of Gerar being their king ( Genesis 21:32, 34 ;  26:1 ). They are, however, not noticed among the Canaanitish tribes mentioned in the Pentateuch. They are spoken of by Amos ( 9:7 ) and Jeremiah ( 47:4 ) as from Caphtor, i.e., probably Crete, or, as some think, the Delta of Egypt. In the whole record from Exodus to Samuel they are represented as inhabiting the tract of country which lay between Judea and Egypt ( Exodus 13:17 ;  15:14, 15 ;  Joshua 13:3 ; 1 Samuel 4).", "This powerful tribe made frequent incursions against the Hebrews. There was almost perpetual war between them. They sometimes held the tribes, especially the southern tribes, in degrading servitude ( Judges 15:11 ;  1 Samuel 13:19-22 ); at other times they were defeated with great slaughter ( 1 Samuel 14:1-47 ; 17). These hostilities did not cease till the time of Hezekiah ( 2 Kings 18:8 ), when they were entirely subdued. They still, however, occupied their territory, and always showed their old hatred to Israel ( Ezekiel 25:15-17 ). They were finally conquered by the Romans.", "The Philistines are called Pulsata or Pulista on the Egyptian monuments; the land of the Philistines (Philistia) being termed Palastu and Pilista in the Assyrian inscriptions. They occupied the five cities of Gaza, Ashkelon, Ashdod, Ekron, and Gath, in the south-western corner of Canaan, which belonged to Egypt up to the closing days of the Nineteenth Dynasty. The occupation took place during the reign of Rameses III. of the Twentieth Dynasty. The Philistines had formed part of the great naval confederacy which attacked Egypt, but were eventually repulsed by that Pharaoh, who, however, could not dislodge them from their settlements in Palestine. As they did not enter Palestine till the time of the Exodus, the use of the name Philistines in  Genesis 26:1  must be proleptic. Indeed the country was properly Gerar, as in ch. 20.", "They are called Allophyli, \"foreigners,\" in the Septuagint, and in the Books of Samuel they are spoken of as uncircumcised.

( Genesis 10:14 ) It has been generally assumed that Caphtor represents Crete, and that the Philistines migrated from that island, either directly or through Egypt, into Palestine. But the name Caphtor is more probably identified with the Egyptian Coptos. [ CAPHTOR, CAPHTORIM ]  History.", "The Philistines must have settled in the land of Canaan before the time of Abraham; for they are noticed in his day as a pastoral tribe in the neighborhood of Gerur. ( Genesis 21:32,34 ;  26:1,8 ) Between the times of Abraham and Joshua the Philistines had changed their quarters, and had advanced northward into the plain of Philistia. The Philistines had at an early period attained proficiency in the arts of peace. Their wealth was abundant, ( Judges 16:5,19 ) and they appear in all respects to have been a prosperous people. Possessed of such elements of power, they had attained in the time of the judges an important position among eastern nations. About B.C. 1200 we find them engaged in successful war with the Sidonians. Justin xviii. 3. The territory of the Philistines having been once occupied by the Canaanites, formed a portion of the promised land, and was assigned the tribe of Judah. ( Joshua 15:2,12,45-47 ) No portion of it, however, was conquered in the lifetime of Joshua, ( Joshua 13:2 ) and even after his death no permanent conquest was effected, ( Judges 3:3 ) though we are informed that the three cities of Gaza, Ashkelon and Ekron were taken. ( Judges 1:18 ) The Philistines soon recovered these, and commenced an aggressive policy against the Isr'lites, by which they gained a complete ascendancy over them. Individual heroes were raised up from time to time, such as Shamgar the son of Anath, ( Judges 3:31 ) and still more Samson, Judges 13-16, but neither of these men succeeded in permanently throwing off the yoke. The Isr'lites attributed their past weakness to their want, of unity, and they desired a king, with the special object of leading them against the foe. ( 1 Samuel 8:20 ) Saul threw off the yoke; and the Philistines were defeated with great slaughter at Geba. ( 1 Samuel 13:3 ) They made no attempt to regain their supremacy for about twenty-five years, and the scene of the next contest shows the altered strength of the two parties. It was no longer in the central country, but in a ravine leading down to the Philistine plain, the valley of Elah, the position of which is about 14 miles southwest of Jerusalem. On this occasion the prowess of young David secured success to Isr'l, and the foe was pursued to the gates of Gath and Ekron. ( 1 Samuel 17:1 ) ... The power of the Philistines was, however, still intact on their own territory. The border warfare was continued. The scene of the next conflict was far to the north, in the valley of Esdr'lon. The battle on this occasion proved disastrous to the Isr'lites; Saul himself perished, and the Philistines penetrated across the Jordan and occupied the, forsaken cities. ( 1 Samuel 31:1-7 ) On the appointment of David to be king, he twice attacked them, and on each occasion with signal success, in the first case capturing their images, in the second pursuing them \"from Geba until thou come to Gazer.\" ( 2 Samuel 5:17-25 ;  1 Chronicles 14:8-16 ) Henceforth the Isr'lites appear as the aggressors. About seven years after the defeat at Rephaim, David, who had now consolidated his power, attacked them on their own soil end took Gath with its dependencies. The whole of Philistine was included in Solomon's empire. Later when the Philistines, joined by the Syrians and Assyrians, made war on the kingdom of Isr'l, Hezekiah formed an alliance with the Egyptians, as a counterpoise to the Assyrians, and the possession of Philistia became henceforth the turning-point of the struggle between the two great empires of the East. The Assyrians under Tartan, the general of Sargon, made an expedition against Egypt, and took Ashdod, as the key of that country. ( Isaiah 20:1,4,5 ) Under Senacherib, Philistia was again the scene of important operations. The Assyrian supremacy was restored by Esarhaddon, and it seems probable that the Assyrians retained their hold on Ashdod until its capture, after a long siege, by Psammetichus. It was about this time that Philistia was traversed by vast Scythian horde on their way to Egypt. The Egyptian ascendancy was not as yet re-established, for we find the next king, Necho, compelled to besiege Gaza on his return from the battle of Megiddo. After the death of Necho the contest was renewed between the Egyptians and the Chaldeans under Nebuchadnezzar, and the result was specially disastrous to the Philistines. The \"old hatred\" that the Philistines bore to the Jews was exhibited in acts of hostility at the time of the Babylonish captivity, ( Ezekiel 25:15-17 ) but on the return this was somewhat abated, for some of the Jews married Philistine women, to the great scandal of their rulers.

In the time of Abraham they inhabited the south-west of Judea, Abimelech of Gerar being their king ( Genesis 21:32, 34 ;  26:1 ). They are, however, not noticed among the Canaanitish tribes mentioned in the Pentateuch. They are spoken of by Amos ( 9:7 ) and Jeremiah ( 47:4 ) as from Caphtor, i.e., probably Crete, or, as some think, the Delta of Egypt.

These hostilities did not cease till the time of Hezekiah ( 2 Kings 18:8 ), when they were entirely subdued.

(For the corresponding dates in our month, see  Jewish calendar  at the end of this volume.) The following are the principal passages in the Pentateuch relating to the Passover: ( Exodus 12:1-51 ;  13:3-10 ;  23:14-19 ;  34:18-26 ;  Leviticus 23:4-14 ;  Numbers 9:1-14 ;  28:16-25 ;  16:1-6 )  Why instituted  .", "This feast was instituted by God to commemorate the deliverance of the Isr'lites from Egyptian bondage and the sparing of their firstborn when the destroying angel smote the first-born of the Egyptians. The deliverance from Egypt was regarded as the starting-point of the Hebrew nation. The Isr'lites were then raised from the condition of bondmen under a foreign tyrant to that of a free people owing allegiance to no one but Jehovah. The prophet in a later age spoke of the event as  a creation  and  a redemption  of the nation. God declares himself to be \"the Creator of Isr'l.\" The Exodus was thus looked upon as the birth of the nation; the Passover was its annual birthday feast. It was the yearly memorial of the dedication of the people to him who had saved their first-born from the destroyer, in order that they might be made holy to himself.  First celebration of the Passover  .", "On the tenth day of the month, the head of each family was to select from the flock either a lamb or a kid, a male of the first year, without blemish. If his family was too small to eat the whole of the lamb, he was permitted to invite his nearest neighbor to join the party. On the fourteenth day of the month he was to kill his lamb, while the sun was setting. He was then to take blood in a basin and with a sprig of hyssop to sprinkle it on the two side-posts and the lintel of the door of the house. The lamb was then thoroughly roasted, whole. It was expressly forbidden that it should be boiled, or that a bone of it should be broken. Unleavened bread and bitter herbs were to be eaten with the flesh. No male who was uncircumcised was to join the company. Each one was to have his loins girt, to hold a staff in his hand, and to have shoes on his feet. He was to eat in haste, and it would seem that he was to stand during the meal. The number of the party was to be calculated as nearly as possible, so that all the flesh of the lamb might be eaten; but if any portion of it happened to remain, it was to be burned in the morning. No morsel of it was to be carried out of the house. The lambs were selected, on the fourteenth they were slain and the blood sprinkled, and in the following evening, after the fifteenth day of the had commenced the first paschal meal was eaten. At midnight the firstborn of the Egyptians were smitten. The king and his people were now urgent that the Isr'lites should start immediately, and readily bestowed on them supplies for the journey. In such haste did the Isr'lites depart, on that very day, ( Numbers 33:3 ) that they packed up their kneading troughs containing the dough prepared for the morrow's provisions, which was not yet leavened.  Observance of the Passover in later times  .", "As the original institution of the Passover in Egypt preceded the establishment of the priesthood and the regulation of the service of the tabernacle. It necessarily fell short in several particulars of the observance of the festival according to the fully-developed ceremonial law. The head of the family slew the lamb in his own house, not in the holy place; the blood was sprinkled on the doorway, not on the altar. But when the law was perfected, certain particulars were altered in order to assimilate the Passover to the accustomed order of religious service. In the twelfth and thirteenth chapters of Exodus there are not only distinct references to the observance of the festival in future ages (e.g.) ( Exodus 12:2,14,17,24-27,42 ;  13:2,5,8-10 ) but there are several injunctions which were evidently not intended for the first Passover, and which indeed could not possibly have been observed. Besides the private family festival, there were public and national sacrifices offered each of the seven days of unleavened bread. ( Numbers 28:19 ) On the second day also the first-fruits of the barley harvest were offered in the temple. ( Leviticus 23:10 ) In the latter notices of the festival in the books of the law there are particulars added which appear as modifications of the original institution. ( Leviticus 23:10-14 ;  Numbers 28:16-25 ;  16:1-6 ) Hence it is not without reason that the Jewish writers have laid great stress on the distinction between \"the Egyptian Passover\" and \"the perpetual Passover.\"  Mode and order of the paschal meal  .", "All work except that belonging to a few trades connected with daily life was suspended for some hours before the evening of the 14th Nisan. It was not lawful to eat any ordinary food after midday. No male was admitted to the table unless he was circumcised, even if he were of the seed of Isr'l. ( Exodus 12:48 ) It was customary for the number of a party to be not less than ten. When the meal was prepared, the family was placed round the table, the paterfamilias taking a place of honor, probably somewhat raised above the rest. When the party was arranged the first cup of wine was filled, and a blessing was asked by the head of the family on the feast, as well as a special, one on the cup. The bitter herbs were then placed on the table, and a portion of them eaten, either with Or without the sauce. The unleavened bread was handed round next and afterward the lamb was placed on the table in front of the head of the family. The paschal lamb could be legally slain and the blood and fat offered only in the national sanctuary. ( 16:2 ) Before the lamb was eaten the second cup of wine was filled, and the son, in accordance with ( Exodus 12:26 ) asked his father the meaning of the feast. In reply, an account was given of the sufferings of the Isr'lites in Egypt and of their deliverance, with a particular explanation of ( 26:5 ) and the first part of the Hallel (a contraction from  Hallelujah ), Psalms 113, 114, was sung. This being gone through, the lamb was carved and eaten. The third cup of wine was poured out and drunk, and soon afterward the fourth. The second part of the Hallel, Psalms 115 to 118 was then sung. A fifth wine-cup appears to have been occasionally produced, But perhaps only in later times. What was termed the greater Hallel, Psalms 120 to 138 was sung on such occasions. The Isr'lites who lived in the country appear to have been accommodated at the feast by the inhabitants of Jerusalem in their houses, so far its there was room for them. ( Matthew 26:18 ;  Luke 22:10-12 ) Those who could not be received into the city encamped without the walls in tents as the pilgrims now do at Mecca.  The Passover as a type  .", "The Passover was not only commemorative but also typical. \"The deliverance which it commemorated was a type of the great salvation it foretold.\"", "No other shadow of things to come contained in the law can vie with the festival of the Passover in expressiveness and completeness. (1) The paschal lamb must of course be regarded as the leading feature in the ceremonial of the festival. The lamb slain typified Christ the \"Lamb of God.\" slain for the sins of the world. Christ \"our Passover is sacrificed for us.\" ( 1 Corinthians 5:7 ) According to the divine purpose, the true Lamb of God was slain at nearly the same time as \"the Lord's Passover\" at the same season of the year; and at the same time of the day as the daily sacrifice at the temple, the crucifixion beginning at the hour of the morning sacrifice and ending at the hour of the evening sacrifice. That the lamb was to be roasted and not boiled has been supposed to commemorate the haste of the departure of the Isr'lites. It is not difficult to determine the reason of the command \"not a bone of him shall be broken.\" The lamb was to be a symbol of unity", "the unity of the family, the unity of the nation, the unity of God with his people whom he had taken into covenant with himself. (2) The unleavened bread ranks next in importance to the paschal lamb. We are warranted in concluding that unleavened bread had a peculiar sacrificial character, according to the law. It seems more reasonable to accept St, Paul's reference to the subject, ( 1 Corinthians 5:6-8 ) as furnishing the true meaning of the symbol. Fermentation is decomposition, a dissolution of unity. The pure dry biscuit would be an apt emblem of unchanged duration, and, in its freedom from foreign mixture, of purity also. (3) The offering of the omer or first sheaf of the harvest, ( Leviticus 23:10-14 ) signified deliverance from winter the bondage of Egypt being well considered as a winter in the history of the nation. (4) The consecration of the first-fruits, the firstborn of the soil, is an easy type of the consecration of the first born of the Isr'lites, and of our own best selves, to God. Further than this (1) the Passover is a type of deliverance from the slavery of sin. (2) It is the passing over of the doom we deserve for your sins, because the blood of Christ has been applied to us by faith. (3) The sprinkling of the blood upon the door-posts was a symbol of open confession of our allegiance and love. (4) The Passover was useless unless eaten; so we live upon the Lord Jesus Christ. (5) It was eaten with bitter herbs, as we must eat our passover with the bitter herbs of repentance and confession, which yet, like the bitter herbs of the Passover, are a fitting and natural accompaniment. (6) As the Isr'lites ate the Passover all prepared for the journey, so do we with a readiness and desire to enter the active service of Christ, and to go on the journey toward heaven.", "ED.)"], "Word": "Passover", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "4": {"Definitions": ["P'ASSOVER ,  noun   [pass and over.] A feast of the Jews, instituted to commemorate the providential escape of the Hebrews, in Egypt, when God smiting the first-born of the Egyptians, passed over the houses of the Israelites, which were marked with the blood of the paschal lamb.", "1.

The lambs were selected, on the fourteenth they were slain and the blood sprinkled, and in the following evening, after the fifteenth day of the had commenced the first paschal meal was eaten. At midnight the firstborn of the Egyptians were smitten. The king and his people were now urgent that the Isr'lites should start immediately, and readily bestowed on them supplies for the journey. In such haste did the Isr'lites depart, on that very day, ( Numbers 33:3 ) that they packed up their kneading troughs containing the dough prepared for the morrow's provisions, which was not yet leavened.  Observance of the Passover in later times  .", "As the original institution of the Passover in Egypt preceded the establishment of the priesthood and the regulation of the service of the tabernacle. It necessarily fell short in several particulars of the observance of the festival according to the fully-developed ceremonial law. The head of the family slew the lamb in his own house, not in the holy place; the blood was sprinkled on the doorway, not on the altar. But when the law was perfected, certain particulars were altered in order to assimilate the Passover to the accustomed order of religious service. In the twelfth and thirteenth chapters of Exodus there are not only distinct references to the observance of the festival in future ages (e.g.) ( Exodus 12:2,14,17,24-27,42 ;  13:2,5,8-10 ) but there are several injunctions which were evidently not intended for the first Passover, and which indeed could not possibly have been observed. Besides the private family festival, there were public and national sacrifices offered each of the seven days of unleavened bread. ( Numbers 28:19 ) On the second day also the first-fruits of the barley harvest were offered in the temple. ( Leviticus 23:10 ) In the latter notices of the festival in the books of the law there are particulars added which appear as modifications of the original institution. ( Leviticus 23:10-14 ;  Numbers 28:16-25 ;  16:1-6 ) Hence it is not without reason that the Jewish writers have laid great stress on the distinction between \"the Egyptian Passover\" and \"the perpetual Passover.\"  Mode and order of the paschal meal  .", "All work except that belonging to a few trades connected with daily life was suspended for some hours before the evening of the 14th Nisan. It was not lawful to eat any ordinary food after midday. No male was admitted to the table unless he was circumcised, even if he were of the seed of Isr'l. ( Exodus 12:48 ) It was customary for the number of a party to be not less than ten. When the meal was prepared, the family was placed round the table, the paterfamilias taking a place of honor, probably somewhat raised above the rest. When the party was arranged the first cup of wine was filled, and a blessing was asked by the head of the family on the feast, as well as a special, one on the cup. The bitter herbs were then placed on the table, and a portion of them eaten, either with Or without the sauce. The unleavened bread was handed round next and afterward the lamb was placed on the table in front of the head of the family. The paschal lamb could be legally slain and the blood and fat offered only in the national sanctuary. ( 16:2 ) Before the lamb was eaten the second cup of wine was filled, and the son, in accordance with ( Exodus 12:26 ) asked his father the meaning of the feast. In reply, an account was given of the sufferings of the Isr'lites in Egypt and of their deliverance, with a particular explanation of ( 26:5 ) and the first part of the Hallel (a contraction from  Hallelujah ), Psalms 113, 114, was sung. This being gone through, the lamb was carved and eaten. The third cup of wine was poured out and drunk, and soon afterward the fourth. The second part of the Hallel, Psalms 115 to 118 was then sung. A fifth wine-cup appears to have been occasionally produced, But perhaps only in later times. What was termed the greater Hallel, Psalms 120 to 138 was sung on such occasions. The Isr'lites who lived in the country appear to have been accommodated at the feast by the inhabitants of Jerusalem in their houses, so far its there was room for them. ( Matthew 26:18 ;  Luke 22:10-12 ) Those who could not be received into the city encamped without the walls in tents as the pilgrims now do at Mecca.  The Passover as a type  .", "The Passover was not only commemorative but also typical. \"The deliverance which it commemorated was a type of the great salvation it foretold.\"", "No other shadow of things to come contained in the law can vie with the festival of the Passover in expressiveness and completeness. (1) The paschal lamb must of course be regarded as the leading feature in the ceremonial of the festival. The lamb slain typified Christ the \"Lamb of God.\" slain for the sins of the world. Christ \"our Passover is sacrificed for us.\" ( 1 Corinthians 5:7 ) According to the divine purpose, the true Lamb of God was slain at nearly the same time as \"the Lord's Passover\" at the same season of the year; and at the same time of the day as the daily sacrifice at the temple, the crucifixion beginning at the hour of the morning sacrifice and ending at the hour of the evening sacrifice. That the lamb was to be roasted and not boiled has been supposed to commemorate the haste of the departure of the Isr'lites. It is not difficult to determine the reason of the command \"not a bone of him shall be broken.\" The lamb was to be a symbol of unity", "the unity of the family, the unity of the nation, the unity of God with his people whom he had taken into covenant with himself. (2) The unleavened bread ranks next in importance to the paschal lamb. We are warranted in concluding that unleavened bread had a peculiar sacrificial character, according to the law. It seems more reasonable to accept St, Paul's reference to the subject, ( 1 Corinthians 5:6-8 ) as furnishing the true meaning of the symbol. Fermentation is decomposition, a dissolution of unity. The pure dry biscuit would be an apt emblem of unchanged duration, and, in its freedom from foreign mixture, of purity also. (3) The offering of the omer or first sheaf of the harvest, ( Leviticus 23:10-14 ) signified deliverance from winter the bondage of Egypt being well considered as a winter in the history of the nation. (4) The consecration of the first-fruits, the firstborn of the soil, is an easy type of the consecration of the first born of the Isr'lites, and of our own best selves, to God. Further than this (1) the Passover is a type of deliverance from the slavery of sin. (2) It is the passing over of the doom we deserve for your sins, because the blood of Christ has been applied to us by faith. (3) The sprinkling of the blood upon the door-posts was a symbol of open confession of our allegiance and love. (4) The Passover was useless unless eaten; so we live upon the Lord Jesus Christ. (5) It was eaten with bitter herbs, as we must eat our passover with the bitter herbs of repentance and confession, which yet, like the bitter herbs of the Passover, are a fitting and natural accompaniment. (6) As the Isr'lites ate the Passover all prepared for the journey, so do we with a readiness and desire to enter the active service of Christ, and to go on the journey toward heaven.", "ED.)"], "Word": "Passover", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "4": {"Definitions": ["P'ASSOVER ,  noun   [pass and over.] A feast of the Jews, instituted to commemorate the providential escape of the Hebrews, in Egypt, when God smiting the first-born of the Egyptians, passed over the houses of the Israelites, which were marked with the blood of the paschal lamb.", "1.

(See  EGYPT .) The name is a compound, as some think, of the words Ra, the \"sun\" or \"sun-god,\" and the article phe, \"the,\" prefixed; hence phera, \"the sun,\" or \"the sun-god.\" But others, perhaps more correctly, think the name derived from Perao, \"the great house\" = his majesty = in Turkish, \"the Sublime Porte.\"", "1.  The Pharaoh who was on the throne when Abram went down into Egypt ( Genesis 12:10-20 ) was probably one of the Hyksos, or \"shepherd kings.\" The Egyptians called the nomad tribes of Syria Shasu, \"plunderers,\" their king or chief Hyk, and hence the name of those invaders who conquered the native kings and established a strong government, with Zoan or Tanis as their capital. They were of Semitic origin, and of kindred blood accordingly with Abram. They were probably driven forward by the pressure of the Hittites. The name they bear on the monuments is \"Mentiu.\"", "2.  The Pharaoh of Joseph's days (Genesis 41) was probably Apopi, or Apopis, the last of the Hyksos kings. To the old native Egyptians, who were an African race, shepherds were \"an abomination;\" but to the Hyksos kings these Asiatic shepherds who now appeared with Jacob at their head were congenial, and being akin to their own race, had a warm welcome ( Genesis 47:5, 6 ). Some argue that Joseph came to Egypt in the reign of Thothmes III., long after the expulsion of the Hyksos, and that his influence is to be seen in the rise and progress of the religious revolution in the direction of monotheism which characterized the middle of the Eighteenth Dynasty. The wife of Amenophis III., of that dynasty, was a Semite. Is this singular fact to be explained from the presence of some of Joseph's kindred at the Egyptian court? Pharaoh said to Joseph, \"Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee: the land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell\" ( Genesis 47:5, 6 ).", "3.  The \"new king who knew not Joseph\" ( Exodus 1:8-22 ) has been generally supposed to have been Aahmes I., or Amosis, as he is called by Josephus. Recent discoveries, however, have led to the conclusion that Seti was the \"new king.\"", "For about seventy years the Hebrews in Egypt were under the powerful protection of Joseph. After his death their condition was probably very slowly and gradually changed. The invaders, the Hyksos, who for some five centuries had been masters of Egypt, were driven out, and the old dynasty restored. The Israelites now began to be looked down upon. They began to be afflicted and tyrannized over. In process of time a change appears to have taken place in the government of Egypt. A new dynasty, the Nineteenth, as it is called, came into power under Seti I., who was its founder. He associated with him in his government his son, Rameses II., when he was yet young, probably ten or twelve years of age.", "Note, Professor Maspero, keeper of the museum of Bulak, near Cairo, had his attention in 1870 directed to the fact that scarabs, i.e., stone and metal imitations of the beetle (symbols of immortality), originally worn as amulets by royal personages, which were evidently genuine relics of the time of the ancient Pharaohs, were being sold at Thebes and different places along the Nile. This led him to suspect that some hitherto undiscovered burial-place of the Pharaohs had been opened, and that these and other relics, now secretly sold, were a part of the treasure found there. For a long time he failed, with all his ingenuity, to find the source of these rare treasures. At length one of those in the secret volunteered to give information regarding this burial-place. The result was that a party was conducted in 1881 to Dier el-Bahari, near Thebes, when the wonderful discovery was made of thirty-six mummies of kings, queens, princes, and high priests hidden away in a cavern prepared for them, where they had lain undisturbed for thirty centuries. \"The temple of Deir el-Bahari stands in the middle of a natural amphitheatre of cliffs, which is only one of a number of smaller amphitheatres into which the limestone mountains of the tombs are broken up. In the wall of rock separating this basin from the one next to it some ancient Egyptian engineers had constructed the hiding-place, whose secret had been kept for nearly three thousand years.\" The exploring party being guided to the place, found behind a great rock a shaft 6 feet square and about 40 feet deep, sunk into the limestone. At the bottom of this a passage led westward for 25 feet, and then turned sharply northward into the very heart of the mountain, where in a chamber 23 feet by 13, and 6 feet in height, they came upon the wonderful treasures of antiquity. The mummies were all carefully secured and brought down to Bulak, where they were deposited in the royal museum, which has now been removed to Ghizeh.", "Among the most notable of the ancient kings of Egypt thus discovered were Thothmes III., Seti I., and Rameses II. Thothmes III. was the most distinguished monarch of the brilliant Eighteenth Dynasty. When this mummy was unwound \"once more, after an interval of thirty-six centuries, human eyes gazed on the features of the man who had conquered Syria and Cyprus and Ethiopia, and had raised Egypt to the highest pinnacle of her power. The spectacle, however, was of brief duration. The remains proved to be in so fragile a state that there was only time to take a hasty photograph, and then the features crumbled to pieces and vanished like an apparition, and so passed away from human view for ever.\" \"It seems strange that though the body of this man,\" who overran Palestine with his armies two hundred years before the birth of Moses, \"mouldered to dust, the flowers with which it had been wreathed were so wonderfully preserved that even their colour could be distinguished\" (Manning's Land of the Pharaohs).", "Seti I. (his throne name Merenptah), the father of Rameses II., was a great and successful warrior, also a great builder. The mummy of this Pharaoh, when unrolled, brought to view \"the most beautiful mummy head ever seen within the walls of the museum. The sculptors of Thebes and Abydos did not flatter this Pharaoh when they gave him that delicate, sweet, and smiling profile which is the admiration of travellers. After a lapse of thirty-two centuries, the mummy retains the same expression which characterized the features of the living man. Most remarkable of all, when compared with the mummy of Rameses II., is the striking resemblance between the father and the son. Seti I. is, as it were, the idealized type of Rameses II. He must have died at an advanced age. The head is shaven, the eyebrows are white, the condition of the body points to considerably more than threescore years of life, thus confirming the opinions of the learned, who have attributed a long reign to this king.\"", "4.  Rameses II., the son of Seti I., is probably the Pharaoh of the Oppression. During his forty years' residence at the court of Egypt, Moses must have known this ruler well. During his sojourn in Midian, however, Rameses died, after a reign of sixty-seven years, and his body embalmed and laid in the royal sepulchre in the Valley of the Tombs of Kings beside that of his father. Like the other mummies found hidden in the cave of Deir el-Bahari, it had been for some reason removed from its original tomb, and probably carried from place to place till finally deposited in the cave where it was so recently discovered.", "In 1886, the mummy of this king, the \"great Rameses,\" the \"Sesostris\" of the Greeks, was unwound, and showed the body of what must have been a robust old man. The features revealed to view are thus described by Maspero: \"The head is long and small in proportion to the body. The top of the skull is quite bare. On the temple there are a few sparse hairs, but at the poll the hair is quite thick, forming smooth, straight locks about two inches in length. White at the time of death, they have been dyed a light yellow by the spices used in embalmment. The forehead is low and narrow; the brow-ridge prominent; the eye-brows are thick and white; the eyes are small and close together; the nose is long, thin, arched like the noses of the Bourbons; the temples are sunk; the cheek-bones very prominent; the ears round, standing far out from the head, and pierced, like those of a woman, for the wearing of earrings; the jaw-bone is massive and strong; the chin very prominent; the mouth small, but thick-lipped; the teeth worn and very brittle, but white and well preserved. The moustache and beard are thin. They seem to have been kept shaven during life, but were probably allowed to grow during the king's last illness, or they may have grown after death. The hairs are white, like those of the head and eyebrows, but are harsh and bristly, and a tenth of an inch in length. The skin is of an earthy-brown, streaked with black. Finally, it may be said, the face of the mummy gives a fair idea of the face of the living king. The expression is unintellectual, perhaps slightly animal; but even under the somewhat grotesque disguise of mummification there is plainly to be seen an air of sovereign majesty, of resolve, and of pride.\"", "Both on his father's and his mother's side it has been pretty clearly shown that Rameses had Chaldean or Mesopotamian blood in his veins to such a degree that he might be called an Assyrian. This fact is thought to throw light on  Isaiah 52:4 .", "5.  The Pharaoh of the Exodus was probably Menephtah I., the fourteenth and eldest surviving son of Rameses II. He resided at Zoan, where he had the various interviews with Moses and Aaron recorded in the book of Exodus. His mummy was not among those found at Deir el-Bahari. It is still a question, however, whether Seti II. or his father Menephtah was the Pharaoh of the Exodus. Some think the balance of evidence to be in favour of the former, whose reign it is known began peacefully, but came to a sudden and disastrous end. The \"Harris papyrus,\" found at Medinet-Abou in Upper Egypt in 1856, a state document written by Rameses III., the second king of the Twentieth Dynasty, gives at length an account of a great exodus from Egypt, followed by wide-spread confusion and anarchy. This, there is great reason to believe, was the Hebrew exodus, with which the Nineteenth Dynasty of the Pharaohs came to an end. This period of anarchy was brought to a close by Setnekht, the founder of the Twentieth Dynasty.", "\"In the spring of 1896, Professor Flinders Petrie discovered, among the ruins of the temple of Menephtah at Thebes, a large granite stela, on which is engraved a hymn of victory commemorating the defeat of Libyan invaders who had overrun the Delta. At the end other victories of Menephtah are glanced at, and it is said that the Israelites (I-s-y-r-a-e-l-u) are minished (?) so that they have no seed.' Menephtah was son and successor of Rameses II., the builder of Pithom, and Egyptian scholars have long seen in him the Pharaoh of the Exodus. The Exodus is also placed in his reign by the Egyptian legend of the event preserved by the historian Manetho. In the inscription the name of the Israelites has no determinative of country' or 'district' attached to it, as is the case with all the other names (Canaan, Ashkelon, Gezer, Khar or Southern Palestine, etc.) mentioned along with it, and it would therefore appear that at the time the hymn was composed, the Israelites had already been lost to the sight of the Egyptians in the desert. At all events they must have had as yet no fixed home or district of their own. We may therefore see in the reference to them the Pharaoh's version of the Exodus, the disasters which befell the Egyptians being naturally passed over in silence, and only the destruction of the men children' of the Israelites being recorded.
