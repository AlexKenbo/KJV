If Christ be not risen, our faith is vain ( 1 Corinthians 15:14 ). The whole of the New Testament revelation rests on this as an historical fact. On the day of Pentecost Peter argued the necessity of Christ's resurrection from the prediction in Psalms 16 ( Acts 2:24-28 ). In his own discourses, also, our Lord clearly intimates his resurrection ( Matthew 20:19 ;  Mark 9:9 ;  14:28 ;  Luke 18:33 ;  John 2:19-22 ).", "The evangelists give circumstantial accounts of the facts connected with that event, and the apostles, also, in their public teaching largely insist upon it. Ten different appearances of our risen Lord are recorded in the New Testament. They may be arranged as follows-", "1.  To Mary Magdalene at the sepulchre alone. This is recorded at length only by John ( 20:11-18 ), and alluded to by Mark ( 16:9-11 ).", "2.  To certain women, \"the other Mary,\" Salome, Joanna, and others, as they returned from the sepulchre. Matthew ( 28:1-10 ) alone gives an account of this. (Comp.  Mark 16:1-8,  and  Luke 24:1-11 .)", "3.  To Simon Peter alone on the day of the resurrection. (See  Luke 24:34 ;  1 Corinthians 15:5 .)", "4.  To the two disciples on the way to Emmaus on the day of the resurrection, recorded fully only by Luke ( 24:13-35 . Comp.  Mark 16:12, 13 ).", "5.  To the ten disciples (Thomas being absent) and others \"with them,\" at Jerusalem on the evening of the resurrection day. One of the evangelists gives an account of this appearance, John ( 20:19-24 ).", "6.  To the disciples again (Thomas being present) at Jerusalem ( Mark 16:14-18 ;  Luke 24:33-40 ;  John 20:26-28 . See also  1 Corinthians 15:5 ).", "7.  To the disciples when fishing at the Sea of Galilee. Of this appearance also John ( 21:1-23 ) alone gives an account.", "8.  To the eleven, and above 500 brethren at once, at an appointed place in Galilee ( 1 Corinthians 15:6 ; comp.  Matthew 28:16-20 ).", "9.  To James, but under what circumstances we are not informed ( 1 Corinthians 15:7 ).", "10.  To the apostles immediately before the ascension. They accompanied him from Jerusalem to Mount Olivet, and there they saw him ascend \"till a cloud received him out of their sight\" ( Mark 16:1 9;  Luke 24:50-52 ;  Acts 1:4-10 ).", "It is worthy of note that it is distinctly related that on most of these occasions our Lord afforded his disciples the amplest opportunity of testing the fact of his resurrection. He conversed with them face to face. They touched him ( Matthew 28:9 ;  Luke 24:39 ;  John 20:27 ), and he ate bread with them ( Luke 24:42, 43 ;  John 21:12, 13 ).", "11.  In addition to the above, mention might be made of Christ's manifestation of himself to Paul at Damascus, who speaks of it as an appearance of the risen Saviour ( Acts 9:3-9, 17 ;  1 Corinthians 15:8 ;  9:1 ).", "It is implied in the words of Luke ( Acts 1:3 ) that there may have been other appearances of which we have no record.", "The resurrection is spoken of as the act (1) of God the Father ( Psalms 16:10 ;  Acts 2:24 ;  3:15 ;  Romans 8:11 ;  Ephesians 1:20 ;  Colossians 2:12 ;  Hebrews 13:20 ); (2) of Christ himself ( John 2:19 ;  10:18 ); and (3) of the Holy Spirit ( 1 Peter 3:18 ).", "The resurrection is a public testimony of Christ's release from his undertaking as surety, and an evidence of the Father's acceptance of his work of redemption. It is a victory over death and the grave for all his followers.", "The importance of Christ's resurrection will be seen when we consider that if he rose the gospel is true, and if he rose not it is false. His resurrection from the dead makes it manifest that his sacrifice was accepted. Our justification was secured by his obedience to the death, and therefore he was raised from the dead ( Romans 4:25 ). His resurrection is a proof that he made a full atonement for our sins, that his sacrifice was accepted as a satisfaction to divine justice, and his blood a ransom for sinners. It is also a pledge and an earnest of the resurrection of all believers ( Romans 8:11 ;  1 Corinthians 6:14 ;  15:47-49 ;  Philippians 3:21 ;  1 John 3:2 ). As he lives, they shall live also.", "It proved him to be the Son of God, inasmuch as it authenticated all his claims ( John 2:19 ;  10:17 ). \"If Christ did not rise, the whole scheme of redemption is a failure, and all the predictions and anticipations of its glorious results for time and for eternity, for men and for angels of every rank and order, are proved to be chimeras. But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first-fruits of them that slept.' Therefore the Bible is true from Genesis to Revelation. The kingdom of darkness has been overthrown, Satan has fallen as lightning from heaven, and the triumph of truth over error, of good over evil, of happiness over misery is for ever secured.\" Hodge.", "With reference to the report which the Roman soldiers were bribed ( Matthew 28:12-14 ) to circulate concerning Christ's resurrection, \"his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept,\" Matthew Henry in his \"Commentary,\" under  John 20:1-10 , fittingly remarks, \"The grave-clothes in which Christ had been buried were found in very good order, which serves for an evidence that his body was not stolen away while men slept.' Robbers of tombs have been known to take away the clothes' and leave the body; but none ever took away the body' and left the clothes, especially when they were fine linen' and new ( Mark 15:46 ). Any one would rather choose to carry a dead body in its clothes than naked.

It will still be the same body ( 1 Corinthians 15:42-44 ) which rises again.", "As to the nature of the resurrection body, (1) it will be spiritual ( 1 Corinthians 15:44 ), i.e., a body adapted to the use of the soul in its glorified state, and to all the conditions of the heavenly state; (2) glorious, incorruptible, and powerful (54); (3) like unto the glorified body of Christ ( Philippians 3:21 ); and (4) immortal ( Revelation 21:4 ).", "Christ's resurrection secures and illustrates that of his people. \"", "1.

On the death of Solomon, the ten tribes, having revolted, sent to invite him to become their king. The conduct of Rehoboam favoured the designs of Jeroboam, and he was accordingly proclaimed \"king of Israel\" ( 1 Kings 12:1-20 ). He rebuilt and fortified Shechem as the capital of his kingdom. He at once adopted means to perpetuate the division thus made between the two parts of the kingdom, and erected at Dan and Bethel, the two extremities of his kingdom, \"golden calves,\" which he set up as symbols of Jehovah, enjoining the people not any more to go up to worship at Jerusalem, but to bring their offerings to the shrines he had erected.
