( Lamentations 2:19 ) forms an exception, as having a fourth clause. (2) Ch. 3 contains three short verses under each letter of the alphabet, the initial letter being three times repeated. (3) Ch. 5 contains the same number of verses as chs. 1,2,4, but without the alphabetic order. Jeremiah was not merely a patriot-poet, weeping over the ruin of his country; he was a prophet who had seen all this coming, and had foretold it as inevitable. There are perhaps few portions of the Old Testament which appear to have done the work they were meant to do more effectually than this. The book has supplied thousands with the fullest utterance for their sorrows in the critical periods of national or individual suffering. We may well believe that it soothed the weary years of the Babylonian exile. It enters largely into the order of the Latin Church for the services of passion-week.

The spirit, tone, language, and subject-matter are in accord with the testimony of tradition in assigning it to him. According to tradition, he retired after the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar to a cavern outside the Damascus gate, where he wrote this book. That cavern is still pointed out. \"In the face of a rocky hill, on the western side of the city, the local belief has placed the grotto of Jeremiah.' There, in that fixed attitude of grief which Michael Angelo has immortalized, the prophet may well be supposed to have mourned the fall of his country\" (Stanley, Jewish Church).", "The book consists of five separate poems.

The chastisement would only be for their good; a better day would dawn for them.

Therefore he puts by the word and substitutes his own stronger I love' (Gr. philo) in its room. A second time he does the same.

Therefore he puts by the word and substitutes his own stronger I love' (Gr. philo) in its room. A second time he does the same.

Sometimes the name extends to the whole tribe, the priests included, ( Exodus 6:25 ;  Leviticus 25:32 ;  Numbers 35:2 ;  Joshua 21:3,41 ) etc; sometimes only to those members of the tribe who were not priests, and as distinguished from them. Sometimes again it is added as an epithet of the smaller portion of the tribe, and we read of \"the priests the Levites.\" ( Joshua 3:3 ;  Ezekiel 44:15 ) The history of the tribe and of the functions attached to its several orders is essential to any right apprehension of the history of Isr'l as a people. It will fall naturally into four great periods-", "I.  The time of the exodus  .", "There is no trace of the consecrated character of the Levites till the institution of a hereditary priesthood in the family of Aaron, during the first withdrawal of Moses to the solitude of Sinai. ( Exodus 24:1 ) The next extension of the idea of the priesthood grew out of the terrible crisis of Exod 32. The tribe stood forth separate and apart, recognizing even in this stern work the spiritual as higher than the natural. From this time they occupied a distinct position. The tribe of Levi was to take the place of that earlier priesthood of the first-born as representatives of the holiness of the people. At the time of their first consecration there were 22,000 of them, almost exactly the number of the first-born males in the whole nation. As the tabernacle was the sign of the presence among the people of their unseen King, so the Levites were, among the other tribes of Isr'l, as the royal guard that waited exclusively on him. It was obviously essential for their work as the bearers and guardians of the sacred tent that there should be a fixed assignment of duties; and now accordingly we meet with the first outlines of the organization which afterward became permanent. The division of the tribe into the three sections that traced their descent from the sons of Levi formed the groundwork of it. The work which they all had to do required a man's full strength, and therefore, though twenty was the starting-point for military service,  Numbers 1 , they were not to enter on their active service till they were thirty. ( Numbers 4:23,30,35 ) At fifty they were to be free from all duties but those of superintendence. ( Numbers 8:25,26 ) (1) The Kohathites, as nearest of kin to the priests, held from the first the highest offices. They were to bear all the vessels of the sanctuary, the ark itself included. ( Numbers 3:31 ;  4:15 ;  31:35 ) (2) the Gershonites had to carry the tent-hangings and curtains. ( Numbers 4:22-26 ) (3) The heavier burden of the boards, bars and pillars of the tabernacle fell on the sons of Merari. The Levites were to have no territorial possessions. In place of them they were to receive from the others the tithes of the produce of the land, from which they, in their turn, offered a tithe to the priests, as a recognition of their higher consecration. ( Numbers 18:21,24,26 ;  Nehemiah 10:37 ) Distinctness and diffusion were both to be secured by the assignment to the whole tribe of forty-eight cities, with an outlying \"suburb,\" ( Numbers 35:2 ) of meadowland for the pasturage of their flocks and herds. The reverence of the people for them was to be heightened by the selection of six of these as cities of refuge. Through the whole land the Levites were to take the place of the old household priests, sharing in all festivals and rejoicings. ( 12:19 ;  14:26,27 ;  26:11 ) Every third year they were to have an additional share in the produce of the land. ( 14:28 ;  26:12 ) To \"the priests the Levites\" was to belong the office of preserving, transcribing and interpreting the law. ( 17:9-12 ;  31:26 ) II.  The period of the judges.", "The successor of Moses, though belonging to another tribe, did all that could be done to make the duty above named a reality. The submission of the Gibeonites enabled him to relieve the tribe-divisions of Gershon and Merari of the most burdensome of their duties. The conquered Hivites became \"hewers of wood and drawers of water\" for the house of Jehovah and for the congregation. ( Joshua 9:27 ) As soon as the conquerors had advanced far enough to proceed to a partition of the country, the forty-eight cities were assigned to them. III.  The monarchy.", "When David's kingdom was established, there came a fuller organization of the whole tribe. Their position in relation to the priesthood was once again definitely recognized. In the worship of the tabernacle under David, as afterward in that of the temple, the Levites were the gatekeepers, vergers, sacristans, choristers, of the central sanctuary of the nation. They were, in the language of ( 1 Chronicles 23:24-32 ) to which we may refer as almost the  locus classicus  on this subject, \"to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of Jehovah, in the courts, and the chambers, and the purifying of all holy things.\" They were, besides this, \"to stand every morning to thank and praise Jehovah, and likewise at even.\" They were, lastly, \"to offer\"", "i.e. to assist the priest in offering", "\"all burnt sacrifices to Jehovah in the sabbaths and on the set feasts.\" They lived for the greater part of the year in their own cities, and came up at fixed periods to take their turn of work. ( 1 Chronicles 25:1 ;  1 Chronicles 26:1 ) ... The educational work which the Levites received for their peculiar duties, no less than their connection, more or less intimate, with the schools of the prophets, would tend to make them the teachers of the others, the transcribers and interpreters of the law, the chroniclers of the times in which they lived. (Thus they became to the Isr'lites what ministers and teachers are to the people now, and this teaching and training the people in morality and religion was no doubt one of the chief reasons why they were set apart by God from the people, and yet among the people.", "ED.) The revolt of the ten tribes, and the policy pursued by Jeroboam, who wished to make the priests the creatures and instruments of the king, and to establish a provincial and divided worship, caused them to leave the cities assigned to them in the territory of Isr'l, and gather round the metropolis of Judah. ( 2 Chronicles 11:13,14 ) In the kingdom of Judah they were, from this time forward, a powerful body, politically as well as ecclesiastically. IV.  After the captivity.", "During the period that followed the captivity of the Levites contributed to the formation of the so-called Great Synagogue. They, with the priests, formed the majority of the permanent Sanhedrin, and as such had a large share in the administration of justice even in capital cases. They appear but seldom in the history of the New Testament."], "Word": "Levites", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}}}

( Lamentations 2:19 ) forms an exception, as having a fourth clause. (2) Ch. 3 contains three short verses under each letter of the alphabet, the initial letter being three times repeated. (3) Ch. 5 contains the same number of verses as chs. 1,2,4, but without the alphabetic order. Jeremiah was not merely a patriot-poet, weeping over the ruin of his country; he was a prophet who had seen all this coming, and had foretold it as inevitable.

The spirit, tone, language, and subject-matter are in accord with the testimony of tradition in assigning it to him. According to tradition, he retired after the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar to a cavern outside the Damascus gate, where he wrote this book. That cavern is still pointed out. \"In the face of a rocky hill, on the western side of the city, the local belief has placed the grotto of Jeremiah.' There, in that fixed attitude of grief which Michael Angelo has immortalized, the prophet may well be supposed to have mourned the fall of his country\" (Stanley, Jewish Church).", "The book consists of five separate poems.

The chastisement would only be for their good; a better day would dawn for them.

Sometimes the name extends to the whole tribe, the priests included, ( Exodus 6:25 ;  Leviticus 25:32 ;  Numbers 35:2 ;  Joshua 21:3,41 ) etc; sometimes only to those members of the tribe who were not priests, and as distinguished from them. Sometimes again it is added as an epithet of the smaller portion of the tribe, and we read of \"the priests the Levites.\" ( Joshua 3:3 ;  Ezekiel 44:15 ) The history of the tribe and of the functions attached to its several orders is essential to any right apprehension of the history of Isr'l as a people. It will fall naturally into four great periods-", "I.  The time of the exodus  .", "There is no trace of the consecrated character of the Levites till the institution of a hereditary priesthood in the family of Aaron, during the first withdrawal of Moses to the solitude of Sinai. ( Exodus 24:1 ) The next extension of the idea of the priesthood grew out of the terrible crisis of Exod 32. The tribe stood forth separate and apart, recognizing even in this stern work the spiritual as higher than the natural. From this time they occupied a distinct position. The tribe of Levi was to take the place of that earlier priesthood of the first-born as representatives of the holiness of the people. At the time of their first consecration there were 22,000 of them, almost exactly the number of the first-born males in the whole nation. As the tabernacle was the sign of the presence among the people of their unseen King, so the Levites were, among the other tribes of Isr'l, as the royal guard that waited exclusively on him. It was obviously essential for their work as the bearers and guardians of the sacred tent that there should be a fixed assignment of duties; and now accordingly we meet with the first outlines of the organization which afterward became permanent. The division of the tribe into the three sections that traced their descent from the sons of Levi formed the groundwork of it. The work which they all had to do required a man's full strength, and therefore, though twenty was the starting-point for military service,  Numbers 1 , they were not to enter on their active service till they were thirty. ( Numbers 4:23,30,35 ) At fifty they were to be free from all duties but those of superintendence. ( Numbers 8:25,26 ) (1) The Kohathites, as nearest of kin to the priests, held from the first the highest offices. They were to bear all the vessels of the sanctuary, the ark itself included. ( Numbers 3:31 ;  4:15 ;  31:35 ) (2) the Gershonites had to carry the tent-hangings and curtains. ( Numbers 4:22-26 ) (3) The heavier burden of the boards, bars and pillars of the tabernacle fell on the sons of Merari. The Levites were to have no territorial possessions. In place of them they were to receive from the others the tithes of the produce of the land, from which they, in their turn, offered a tithe to the priests, as a recognition of their higher consecration. ( Numbers 18:21,24,26 ;  Nehemiah 10:37 ) Distinctness and diffusion were both to be secured by the assignment to the whole tribe of forty-eight cities, with an outlying \"suburb,\" ( Numbers 35:2 ) of meadowland for the pasturage of their flocks and herds. The reverence of the people for them was to be heightened by the selection of six of these as cities of refuge. Through the whole land the Levites were to take the place of the old household priests, sharing in all festivals and rejoicings. ( 12:19 ;  14:26,27 ;  26:11 ) Every third year they were to have an additional share in the produce of the land. ( 14:28 ;  26:12 ) To \"the priests the Levites\" was to belong the office of preserving, transcribing and interpreting the law. ( 17:9-12 ;  31:26 ) II.  The period of the judges.", "The successor of Moses, though belonging to another tribe, did all that could be done to make the duty above named a reality. The submission of the Gibeonites enabled him to relieve the tribe-divisions of Gershon and Merari of the most burdensome of their duties. The conquered Hivites became \"hewers of wood and drawers of water\" for the house of Jehovah and for the congregation. ( Joshua 9:27 ) As soon as the conquerors had advanced far enough to proceed to a partition of the country, the forty-eight cities were assigned to them. III.  The monarchy.", "When David's kingdom was established, there came a fuller organization of the whole tribe. Their position in relation to the priesthood was once again definitely recognized. In the worship of the tabernacle under David, as afterward in that of the temple, the Levites were the gatekeepers, vergers, sacristans, choristers, of the central sanctuary of the nation. They were, in the language of ( 1 Chronicles 23:24-32 ) to which we may refer as almost the  locus classicus  on this subject, \"to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of Jehovah, in the courts, and the chambers, and the purifying of all holy things.\" They were, besides this, \"to stand every morning to thank and praise Jehovah, and likewise at even.\" They were, lastly, \"to offer\"", "i.e. to assist the priest in offering", "\"all burnt sacrifices to Jehovah in the sabbaths and on the set feasts.\" They lived for the greater part of the year in their own cities, and came up at fixed periods to take their turn of work. ( 1 Chronicles 25:1 ;  1 Chronicles 26:1 ) ... The educational work which the Levites received for their peculiar duties, no less than their connection, more or less intimate, with the schools of the prophets, would tend to make them the teachers of the others, the transcribers and interpreters of the law, the chroniclers of the times in which they lived. (Thus they became to the Isr'lites what ministers and teachers are to the people now, and this teaching and training the people in morality and religion was no doubt one of the chief reasons why they were set apart by God from the people, and yet among the people.", "ED.) The revolt of the ten tribes, and the policy pursued by Jeroboam, who wished to make the priests the creatures and instruments of the king, and to establish a provincial and divided worship, caused them to leave the cities assigned to them in the territory of Isr'l, and gather round the metropolis of Judah. ( 2 Chronicles 11:13,14 ) In the kingdom of Judah they were, from this time forward, a powerful body, politically as well as ecclesiastically. IV.  After the captivity.", "During the period that followed the captivity of the Levites contributed to the formation of the so-called Great Synagogue. They, with the priests, formed the majority of the permanent Sanhedrin, and as such had a large share in the administration of justice even in capital cases. They appear but seldom in the history of the New Testament."], "Word": "Levites", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}}}

( Genesis 13:10-14 ) The next occurrence in the life of Lot is his capture by the four kings of the east and his rescue by Abram. ch.

It cannot be necessary to create the details of the story where none are given. On these points the record is silent. The value and the significance of the story to us are contained in the allusion of Christ.

The custom of deciding doubtful questions by lot is one of great extent and high antiquity. Among the Jews lots were used with the expectation that God would so control them as to give a right direction to them. They were very often used by God's appointment. \"As to the mode of casting lots, we have no certain information. Probably several modes were practiced.\" \"Very commonly among the Latins little counters of wood were put into a jar with so narrow a neck that only one could come out at a time. After the jar had been filled with water and the contents shaken, the lots were determined by the order in which the bits of wood, representing the several parties, came out with the water. in other cases they were put into a wide open jar, and the counters were drawn out by the hand. Sometimes again they were cast in the manner of dice. The soldiers who cast lots for Christ's garments undoubtedly used these dice.\"", "Lyman Abbott. 3. \u00a0In \"Baal-hazor which is by Ephraim\" was Absalom's sheepfarm, at which took place the murder of Amnon, one of the earliest precursors of the great revolt.

Sometimes the name extends to the whole tribe, the priests included, ( Exodus 6:25 ;  Leviticus 25:32 ;  Numbers 35:2 ;  Joshua 21:3,41 ) etc; sometimes only to those members of the tribe who were not priests, and as distinguished from them. Sometimes again it is added as an epithet of the smaller portion of the tribe, and we read of \"the priests the Levites.\" ( Joshua 3:3 ;  Ezekiel 44:15 ) The history of the tribe and of the functions attached to its several orders is essential to any right apprehension of the history of Isr'l as a people. It will fall naturally into four great periods-", "I.  The time of the exodus  .", "There is no trace of the consecrated character of the Levites till the institution of a hereditary priesthood in the family of Aaron, during the first withdrawal of Moses to the solitude of Sinai. ( Exodus 24:1 ) The next extension of the idea of the priesthood grew out of the terrible crisis of Exod 32. The tribe stood forth separate and apart, recognizing even in this stern work the spiritual as higher than the natural. From this time they occupied a distinct position. The tribe of Levi was to take the place of that earlier priesthood of the first-born as representatives of the holiness of the people. At the time of their first consecration there were 22,000 of them, almost exactly the number of the first-born males in the whole nation. As the tabernacle was the sign of the presence among the people of their unseen King, so the Levites were, among the other tribes of Isr'l, as the royal guard that waited exclusively on him. It was obviously essential for their work as the bearers and guardians of the sacred tent that there should be a fixed assignment of duties; and now accordingly we meet with the first outlines of the organization which afterward became permanent. The division of the tribe into the three sections that traced their descent from the sons of Levi formed the groundwork of it. The work which they all had to do required a man's full strength, and therefore, though twenty was the starting-point for military service,  Numbers 1 , they were not to enter on their active service till they were thirty. ( Numbers 4:23,30,35 ) At fifty they were to be free from all duties but those of superintendence. ( Numbers 8:25,26 ) (1) The Kohathites, as nearest of kin to the priests, held from the first the highest offices. They were to bear all the vessels of the sanctuary, the ark itself included. ( Numbers 3:31 ;  4:15 ;  31:35 ) (2) the Gershonites had to carry the tent-hangings and curtains. ( Numbers 4:22-26 ) (3) The heavier burden of the boards, bars and pillars of the tabernacle fell on the sons of Merari. The Levites were to have no territorial possessions. In place of them they were to receive from the others the tithes of the produce of the land, from which they, in their turn, offered a tithe to the priests, as a recognition of their higher consecration. ( Numbers 18:21,24,26 ;  Nehemiah 10:37 ) Distinctness and diffusion were both to be secured by the assignment to the whole tribe of forty-eight cities, with an outlying \"suburb,\" ( Numbers 35:2 ) of meadowland for the pasturage of their flocks and herds. The reverence of the people for them was to be heightened by the selection of six of these as cities of refuge. Through the whole land the Levites were to take the place of the old household priests, sharing in all festivals and rejoicings. ( 12:19 ;  14:26,27 ;  26:11 ) Every third year they were to have an additional share in the produce of the land. ( 14:28 ;  26:12 ) To \"the priests the Levites\" was to belong the office of preserving, transcribing and interpreting the law. ( 17:9-12 ;  31:26 ) II.  The period of the judges.", "The successor of Moses, though belonging to another tribe, did all that could be done to make the duty above named a reality. The submission of the Gibeonites enabled him to relieve the tribe-divisions of Gershon and Merari of the most burdensome of their duties. The conquered Hivites became \"hewers of wood and drawers of water\" for the house of Jehovah and for the congregation. ( Joshua 9:27 ) As soon as the conquerors had advanced far enough to proceed to a partition of the country, the forty-eight cities were assigned to them. III.  The monarchy.", "When David's kingdom was established, there came a fuller organization of the whole tribe. Their position in relation to the priesthood was once again definitely recognized. In the worship of the tabernacle under David, as afterward in that of the temple, the Levites were the gatekeepers, vergers, sacristans, choristers, of the central sanctuary of the nation. They were, in the language of ( 1 Chronicles 23:24-32 ) to which we may refer as almost the  locus classicus  on this subject, \"to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of Jehovah, in the courts, and the chambers, and the purifying of all holy things.\" They were, besides this, \"to stand every morning to thank and praise Jehovah, and likewise at even.\" They were, lastly, \"to offer\"", "i.e. to assist the priest in offering", "\"all burnt sacrifices to Jehovah in the sabbaths and on the set feasts.\" They lived for the greater part of the year in their own cities, and came up at fixed periods to take their turn of work. ( 1 Chronicles 25:1 ;  1 Chronicles 26:1 ) ... The educational work which the Levites received for their peculiar duties, no less than their connection, more or less intimate, with the schools of the prophets, would tend to make them the teachers of the others, the transcribers and interpreters of the law, the chroniclers of the times in which they lived. (Thus they became to the Isr'lites what ministers and teachers are to the people now, and this teaching and training the people in morality and religion was no doubt one of the chief reasons why they were set apart by God from the people, and yet among the people.", "ED.) The revolt of the ten tribes, and the policy pursued by Jeroboam, who wished to make the priests the creatures and instruments of the king, and to establish a provincial and divided worship, caused them to leave the cities assigned to them in the territory of Isr'l, and gather round the metropolis of Judah. ( 2 Chronicles 11:13,14 ) In the kingdom of Judah they were, from this time forward, a powerful body, politically as well as ecclesiastically. IV.  After the captivity.", "During the period that followed the captivity of the Levites contributed to the formation of the so-called Great Synagogue. They, with the priests, formed the majority of the permanent Sanhedrin, and as such had a large share in the administration of justice even in capital cases.

There are eleven in Deuteronomy which do not occur in Leviticus, and these are nearly all animals and birds which are not found in Egypt or the Holy Land, but which are numerous in the Arabian desert. They are not named in Leviticus a few weeks after the departure from Egypt; but after the people were thirty-nine years in the desert they are named, a strong proof that the list in Deuteronomy was written at the end of the journey, and the list in Leviticus at the beginning. It fixes the writing of that catalogue to one time and period only, viz., that when the children of Israel were familiar with the fauna and the flora of the desert\" (Palest. Expl.

( Lamentations 2:19 ) forms an exception, as having a fourth clause. (2) Ch. 3 contains three short verses under each letter of the alphabet, the initial letter being three times repeated. (3) Ch. 5 contains the same number of verses as chs. 1,2,4, but without the alphabetic order. Jeremiah was not merely a patriot-poet, weeping over the ruin of his country; he was a prophet who had seen all this coming, and had foretold it as inevitable. There are perhaps few portions of the Old Testament which appear to have done the work they were meant to do more effectually than this. The book has supplied thousands with the fullest utterance for their sorrows in the critical periods of national or individual suffering. We may well believe that it soothed the weary years of the Babylonian exile. It enters largely into the order of the Latin Church for the services of passion-week.

In the Hebrew Bible it is placed among the Khethubim. (See  BIBLE .)", "As to its authorship, there is no room for hesitancy in following the LXX. and the Targum in ascribing it to Jeremiah. The spirit, tone, language, and subject-matter are in accord with the testimony of tradition in assigning it to him. According to tradition, he retired after the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar to a cavern outside the Damascus gate, where he wrote this book. That cavern is still pointed out. \"In the face of a rocky hill, on the western side of the city, the local belief has placed the grotto of Jeremiah.' There, in that fixed attitude of grief which Michael Angelo has immortalized, the prophet may well be supposed to have mourned the fall of his country\" (Stanley, Jewish Church).", "The book consists of five separate poems.

In chapter 2 these miseries are described in connection with the national sins that had caused them. Chapter 3 speaks of hope for the people of God. The chastisement would only be for their good; a better day would dawn for them.

This name is from the Greek lepra, by which the Greek physicians designated the disease from its scaliness. We have the description of the disease, as well as the regulations connected with it, in Leviticus 13; 14;  Numbers 12:10-15 , etc. There were reckoned six different circumstances under which it might develop itself, (1) without any apparent cause ( Leviticus 13:2-8) ; (2) its reappearance (9-17); (3) from an inflammation (18-28); (4) on the head or chin (29-37); (5) in white polished spots (38, 39); (6) at the back or in the front of the head (40-44).", "Lepers were required to live outside the camp or city ( Numbers 5:1-4;   12:10-15,  etc.). This disease was regarded as an awful punishment from the Lord ( 2 Kings 5:7 ;  2 Chronicles 26:20 ). (See  MIRIAM ;  GEHAZI ;  UZZIAH .)", "This disease \"begins with specks on the eyelids and on the palms, gradually spreading over the body, bleaching the hair white wherever they appear, crusting the affected parts with white scales, and causing terrible sores and swellings. From the skin the disease eats inward to the bones, rotting the whole body piecemeal.\" \"In Christ's day no leper could live in a walled town, though he might in an open village. But wherever he was he was required to have his outer garment rent as a sign of deep grief, to go bareheaded, and to cover his beard with his mantle, as if in lamentation at his own virtual death. He had further to warn passers-by to keep away from him, by calling out, Unclean! unclean!' nor could he speak to any one, or receive or return a salutation, since in the East this involves an embrace.\"", "That the disease was not contagious is evident from the regulations regarding it ( Leviticus 13:12, 13, 36 ;  2 Kings 5:1 ). Leprosy was \"the outward and visible sign of the innermost spiritual corruption; a meet emblem in its small beginnings, its gradual spread, its internal disfigurement, its dissolution little by little of the whole body, of that which corrupts, degrades, and defiles man's inner nature, and renders him unmeet to enter the presence of a pure and holy God\" (Maclear's Handbook O.T).

The sudden and total change of food, air, dwelling and mode of life, caused by the exodus, to this nation of newly-emancipated slaves, may possibly have had a further tendency to produce skin disorders, and severe repressive measures may have been required in the desert-moving camp to secure the public health or to allay the panic of infection. Hence it is possible that many, perhaps most, of this repertory of symptoms may have disappeared with the period of the exodus, and the snow-white form, which had pre-existed, may alone have ordinarily continued in a later age. The principal morbid features are a rising or swelling, a scab or baldness, and a bright or white spot.

It is clear that the leprosy of Leviticus 13,14 means any severe disease spreading on the surface of the body in the way described, and so shocking of aspect, or so generally suspected of infection, that public feeling called for separation. It is now undoubted that the \"leprosy\" of modern Syria, and which has a wide range in Spain, Greece and Norway, is the  Elephantiasis gr'corum  . It is said to have been brought home by the crusaders into the various countries of western and northern Europe. It certainly was not the distinctive white leprosy, nor do any of the described symptoms in Leviticus 13 point to elephantiasis. \"White as snow,\" ( 2 Kings 5:27 ) would be a inapplicable to elephantiasis as to small-pox. There remains a curious question as regards the leprosy of garments and houses. Some have though garments worn by leprous patients intended. This classing of garments and house-walls with the human epidermis, as leprous, has moved the mirth of some and the wonder of others. Yet modern science has established what goes far to vindicate the Mosaic classification as more philosophical than such cavils. It is now known that there are some skin diseases which originate in an acarus, and others which proceed from a fungus. In these we may probably find the solution of the paradox. The analogy between the insect which frets the human skin and that which frets the garment that covers it", "between the fungous growth that lines the crevices of the epidermis and that which creeps in the interstices of masonry", "is close enough for the purposes of a ceremonial law. It is manifest also that a disease in the human subject caused by an acarus or by a fungus would be certainly contagious, since the propagative cause could be transferred from person to person. (Geikie in his \"Life of Christ\" says- \"Leprosy signifies  smiting  , because it was supposed to be a direct visitation of Heaven. It began with little specks on the eyelids and on the palms of the hands, and gradually spread over different parts of the body, bleaching the hair white wherever it showed itself, crusting the affected parts with shining scales, and causing swellings and sores. From the skin it slowly ate its way through the tissues, to the bones and joints, and even to the marrow, rotting the whole body piecemeal. The lungs, the organs of speech and hearing, and the eyes, were attacked in turn, till at last consumption or dropsy brought welcome death. The dread of infection kept men aloof from the sufferer; and the law proscribed him as above all men unclean. The disease was hereditary to the fourth generation.\"  Leprosy in the United States.", "The  Medical Record  , February, 1881, states that from the statistics collected by the Dermatological Society it appears that there are between fifty and one hundred lepers in the United States at present.  Is modern leprosy contagious?", "Dr. H.S. Piffard of New York, in the  Medical Record  , February, 1881, decides that it is in a modified degree contagious. \"A review of the evidence led to the conclusion that this disease was not contagious by ordinary contact; but it may be transmitted by the blood and secretions. A recent writer, Dr. Bross, a Jesuit missionary attached to the lazaretto at Trinidad, takes the ground that the disease in some way or other is transmissible. It is a well-established fact that when leprosy has once gained for itself a foothold in any locality, it is apt to remain there and spread. The case of the Sandwich Islands illustrates the danger. Forty years ago the disease did not exits there; now one-tenth of the inhabitants are lepers.\" This is further confirmed by the fact stated by Dr. J. Hutchinson, F.R.S., that \"We find that nearly everywhere the disease is most common on the seashore, and that, when it spreads inland, it generally occurs on the shores of lakes or along the course of large rivers.\"  Leprosy as a type of sin.", "\"Being the worst form of disease, leprosy was fixed upon by God to be  the especial type of sin,  and the injunctions regarding it had reference to its typical character.\" It was (1) hereditary; (2) contagious; (3) ever tending to increase; (4) incurable except by the power of God; (5) a shame and disgrace; (6) rendering one alone in the world; (7) deforming, unclean; (8) \"separating the soul from God, producing spiritual death; unfitting it forever for heaven and the company of they holy, and insuring its eternal banishment, as polluted and abominable.\" (9) Another point is referred to by Thompson (in \"The Land and the Book\")- \"Some, as they look on infancy, reject with horror the thought that sin exists within. But so might any one say who looked upon the beautiful babe in the arms of a leprous mother. But time brings forth the fearful malady. New-born babes of leprous parents are often as pretty and as healthy in appearance as any; but by and by its presence and workings become visible in some of the signs described in the thirteenth chapter of Leviticus.\"", "ED.)"], "Word": "Leper, Leprosy", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}}}

It is clear that the leprosy of Leviticus 13,14 means any severe disease spreading on the surface of the body in the way described, and so shocking of aspect, or so generally suspected of infection, that public feeling called for separation. It is now undoubted that the \"leprosy\" of modern Syria, and which has a wide range in Spain, Greece and Norway, is the  Elephantiasis gr'corum  . It is said to have been brought home by the crusaders into the various countries of western and northern Europe. It certainly was not the distinctive white leprosy, nor do any of the described symptoms in Leviticus 13 point to elephantiasis. \"White as snow,\" ( 2 Kings 5:27 ) would be a inapplicable to elephantiasis as to small-pox. There remains a curious question as regards the leprosy of garments and houses. Some have though garments worn by leprous patients intended. This classing of garments and house-walls with the human epidermis, as leprous, has moved the mirth of some and the wonder of others. Yet modern science has established what goes far to vindicate the Mosaic classification as more philosophical than such cavils. It is now known that there are some skin diseases which originate in an acarus, and others which proceed from a fungus. In these we may probably find the solution of the paradox. The analogy between the insect which frets the human skin and that which frets the garment that covers it", "between the fungous growth that lines the crevices of the epidermis and that which creeps in the interstices of masonry", "is close enough for the purposes of a ceremonial law. It is manifest also that a disease in the human subject caused by an acarus or by a fungus would be certainly contagious, since the propagative cause could be transferred from person to person. (Geikie in his \"Life of Christ\" says- \"Leprosy signifies  smiting  , because it was supposed to be a direct visitation of Heaven. It began with little specks on the eyelids and on the palms of the hands, and gradually spread over different parts of the body, bleaching the hair white wherever it showed itself, crusting the affected parts with shining scales, and causing swellings and sores. From the skin it slowly ate its way through the tissues, to the bones and joints, and even to the marrow, rotting the whole body piecemeal. The lungs, the organs of speech and hearing, and the eyes, were attacked in turn, till at last consumption or dropsy brought welcome death. The dread of infection kept men aloof from the sufferer; and the law proscribed him as above all men unclean. The disease was hereditary to the fourth generation.\"  Leprosy in the United States.", "The  Medical Record  , February, 1881, states that from the statistics collected by the Dermatological Society it appears that there are between fifty and one hundred lepers in the United States at present.  Is modern leprosy contagious?", "Dr. H.S. Piffard of New York, in the  Medical Record  , February, 1881, decides that it is in a modified degree contagious. \"A review of the evidence led to the conclusion that this disease was not contagious by ordinary contact; but it may be transmitted by the blood and secretions. A recent writer, Dr. Bross, a Jesuit missionary attached to the lazaretto at Trinidad, takes the ground that the disease in some way or other is transmissible. It is a well-established fact that when leprosy has once gained for itself a foothold in any locality, it is apt to remain there and spread. The case of the Sandwich Islands illustrates the danger. Forty years ago the disease did not exits there; now one-tenth of the inhabitants are lepers.\" This is further confirmed by the fact stated by Dr. J. Hutchinson, F.R.S., that \"We find that nearly everywhere the disease is most common on the seashore, and that, when it spreads inland, it generally occurs on the shores of lakes or along the course of large rivers.\"  Leprosy as a type of sin.", "\"Being the worst form of disease, leprosy was fixed upon by God to be  the especial type of sin,  and the injunctions regarding it had reference to its typical character.\" It was (1) hereditary; (2) contagious; (3) ever tending to increase; (4) incurable except by the power of God; (5) a shame and disgrace; (6) rendering one alone in the world; (7) deforming, unclean; (8) \"separating the soul from God, producing spiritual death; unfitting it forever for heaven and the company of they holy, and insuring its eternal banishment, as polluted and abominable.\" (9) Another point is referred to by Thompson (in \"The Land and the Book\")- \"Some, as they look on infancy, reject with horror the thought that sin exists within. But so might any one say who looked upon the beautiful babe in the arms of a leprous mother. But time brings forth the fearful malady. New-born babes of leprous parents are often as pretty and as healthy in appearance as any; but by and by its presence and workings become visible in some of the signs described in the thirteenth chapter of Leviticus.\"", "ED.)"], "Word": "Leper, Leprosy", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}}}
