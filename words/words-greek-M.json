The objection commonly made against any  sinapis  being the plant of the parable is that the reed grew into \"a tree,\" in which the fowls of the air are said to come and lodge. As to this objection, it is urged with great truth that the expression is figurative and Oriental, and that in a proverbial simile no literal accuracy is to be expected. It is an error, for which the language of Scripture is not accountable, to assert that the passage implies that birds \"built their nests\" in the tree: the Greek word has no such meaning; the word merely means \"to settle or rest upon\" anything for a longer or shorter time; nor is there any occasion to suppose that the expression \"fowls of the air\" denotes any other than the smaller  insessorial  kinds", "linnets, finches, etc. Hiller's explanation is probably the correct one,", "that the birds came and settled on the mustard-plant for the sake of the seed, of which they are very fond.

If, then, the wild plant on the rich plain of Akkar grows as high as a man on horseback, it might attain to the same or a greater height when in a cultivated garden. The expression \"which is indeed-the least of all seeds\" is in all probability hyperbolical, to denote a very small seed indeed, as there are many seeds which are smaller than mustard. The Lord in his popular teaching,\" says Trench (\"Notes on Parables\", 108), \"adhered to the popular language;\" and the mustard-seed was used proverbially to denote anything very minute; or may mean that it was the smallest of all garden seeds, which it is in truth."], "Word": "Mustard", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "7": {"Definitions": ["MUS'TARD ,  noun   A plant of the genus Sinapis, and its seed, which has a pungent taste and is a powerful stimulant.

The wife of Joseph, the mother of Jesus, called the \"Virgin Mary,\" though never so designated in Scripture ( Matthew 2:11 ;  Acts 1:14 ). Little is known of her personal history. Her genealogy is given in Luke 3. She was of the tribe of Judah and the lineage of David ( Psalms 132:11 ;  Luke 1:32 ). She was connected by marriage with Elisabeth, who was of the lineage of Aaron ( Luke 1:36 ).", "While she resided at Nazareth with her parents, before she became the wife of Joseph, the angel Gabriel announced to her that she was to be the mother of the promised Messiah ( Luke 1:35 ). After this she went to visit her cousin Elisabeth, who was living with her husband Zacharias (probably at Juttah,  Joshua 15:55 ;  21:16 , in the neighbourhood of Maon), at a considerable distance, about 100 miles, from Nazareth. Immediately on entering the house she was saluted by Elisabeth as the mother of her Lord, and then forthwith gave utterance to her hymn of thanksgiving ( Luke 1:46-56 ; comp.  1 Samuel 2:1-10 ). After three months Mary returned to Nazareth to her own home. Joseph was supernaturally made aware ( Matthew 1:18-25 ) of her condition, and took her to his own home. Soon after this the decree of Augustus ( Luke 2:1 ) required that they should proceed to Bethlehem ( Micah 5:2 ), some 80 or 90 miles from Nazareth; and while they were there they found shelter in the inn or khan provided for strangers ( Luke 2:6, 7 ). But as the inn was crowded, Mary had to retire to a place among the cattle, and there she brought forth her son, who was called Jesus ( Matthew 1:21 ), because he was to save his people from their sins. This was followed by the presentation in the temple, the flight into Egypt, and their return in the following year and residence at Nazareth (Matthew 2). There for thirty years Mary, the wife of Joseph the carpenter, resides, filling her own humble sphere, and pondering over the strange things that had happened to her. During these years only one event in the history of Jesus is recorded, viz., his going up to Jerusalem when twelve years of age, and his being found among the doctors in the temple ( Luke 2:41-52 ). Probably also during this period Joseph died, for he is not again mentioned.", "After the commencement of our Lord's public ministry little notice is taken of Mary. She was present at the marriage in Cana. A year and a half after this we find her at Capernaum ( Matthew 12:46, 48, 49 ), where Christ uttered the memorable words, \"Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!\" The next time we find her is at the cross along with her sister Mary, and Mary Magdalene, and Salome, and other women ( John 19:26 ). From that hour John took her to his own abode. She was with the little company in the upper room after the Ascension ( Acts 1:14 ). From this time she wholly disappears from public notice. The time and manner of her death are unknown.", "2.  Mary Magdalene, i.e., Mary of Magdala, a town on the western shore of the Lake of Tiberias. She is for the first time noticed in  Luke 8:3  as one of the women who \"ministered to Christ of their substance.\" Their motive was that of gratitude for deliverances he had wrought for them. Out of Mary were cast seven demons. Gratitude to her great Deliverer prompted her to become his follower. These women accompanied him also on his last journey to Jerusalem ( Matthew 27:55 ;  Mark 15:41 ;  Luke 23:55 ). They stood near the cross. There Mary remained till all was over, and the body was taken down and laid in Joseph's tomb. Again, in the earliest dawn of the first day of the week she, with Salome and Mary the mother of James ( Matthew 28:1 ;  Mark 16:2 ), came to the sepulchre, bringing with them sweet spices, that they might anoint the body of Jesus. They found the sepulchre empty, but saw the \"vision of angels\" ( Matthew 28:5 ). She hastens to tell Peter and John, who were probably living together at this time ( John 20:1, 2 ), and again immediately returns to the sepulchre. There she lingers thoughtfully, weeping at the door of the tomb. The risen Lord appears to her, but at first she knows him not. His utterance of her name \"Mary\" recalls her to consciousness, and she utters the joyful, reverent cry, \"Rabboni.\" She would fain cling to him, but he forbids her, saying, \"Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father.\" This is the last record regarding Mary of Magdala, who now returned to Jerusalem. The idea that this Mary was \"the woman who was a sinner,\" or that she was unchaste, is altogether groundless.", "3.  Mary the sister of Lazarus is brought to our notice in connection with the visits of our Lord to Bethany. She is contrasted with her sister Martha, who was \"cumbered about many things\" while Jesus was their guest, while Mary had chosen \"the good part.\" Her character also appears in connection with the death of her brother ( John 11:20, 31, 33 ). On the occasion of our Lord's last visit to Bethany, Mary brought \"a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus\" as he reclined at table in the house of one Simon, who had been a leper ( Matthew 26:6 ;  Mark 14:3 ;  John 12:2, 3 ). This was an evidence of her overflowing love to the Lord. Nothing is known of her subsequent history. It would appear from this act of Mary's, and from the circumstance that they possessed a family vault ( 11:38 ), and that a large number of Jews from Jerusalem came to condole with them on the death of Lazarus ( 11:19 ), that this family at Bethany belonged to the wealthier class of the people. (See MARTHA.)", "4.  Mary the wife of Cleopas is mentioned ( John 19:25 ) as standing at the cross in company with Mary of Magdala and Mary the mother of Jesus. By comparing  Matthew 27:56  and  Mark 15:40 , we find that this Mary and \"Mary the mother of James the little\" are on and the same person, and that she was the sister of our Lord's mother. She was that \"other Mary\" who was present with Mary of Magdala at the burial of our Lord ( Matthew 27:61 ;  Mark 15:47 ); and she was one of those who went early in the morning of the first day of the week to anoint the body, and thus became one of the first witnesses of the resurrection ( Matthew 28:1 ;  Mark 16:1 ;  Luke 24:1 ).", "5.  Mary the mother of John Mark was one of the earliest of our Lord's disciples. She was the sister of Barnabas ( Colossians 4:10 ), and joined with him in disposing of their land and giving the proceeds of the sale into the treasury of the Church ( Acts 4:37 ;  12:12 ).

The probability is that it was written between the years A.D. 60 and 65.", "The cast of thought and the forms of expression employed by the writer show that this Gospel was written for Jewish Christians of Palestine. His great object is to prove that Jesus of Nazareth was the promised Messiah, and that in him the ancient prophecies had their fulfilment. The Gospel is full of allusions to those passages of the Old Testament in which Christ is predicted and foreshadowed. The one aim prevading the whole book is to show that Jesus is he \"of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write.\" This Gospel contains no fewer than sixty-five references to the Old Testament, forty-three of these being direct verbal citations, thus greatly outnumbering those found in the other Gospels. The main feature of this Gospel may be expressed in the motto, \"I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.\"", "As to the language in which this Gospel was written there is much controversy. Many hold, in accordance with old tradition, that it was originally written in Hebrew (i.e., the Aramaic or Syro-Chaldee dialect, then the vernacular of the inhabitants of Palestine), and afterwards translated into Greek, either by Matthew himself or by some person unknown. This theory, though earnestly maintained by able critics, we cannot see any ground for adopting. From the first this Gospel in Greek was received as of authority in the Church. There is nothing in it to show that it is a translation. Though Matthew wrote mainly for the Jews, yet they were everywhere familiar with the Greek language.
