Its trade was considerable; it lay on the line of a great road; and it was the seat of a  conventus  . From the third chapter and seventeenth verse of Revelation we should gather it was a place of great wealth. Christianity was introduced into Laodicea, not, however, as it would seem, through the direct agency of St. Paul. We have good reason for believing that when, in writing from Rome to the Christians of Coloss', he sent a greeting to those of Laodicea, he had not personally visited either place. But the preaching of the gospel at Ephesus, ( Acts 18:19 ;  Acts 19:41 ) must inevitably have resulted in the formation of churches in the neighboring cities, especially where Jews were settled; and there were Jews in Laodicea. In subsequent times it became a Christian city of eminence, the see of bishop and a meeting-place of councils. The Mohammedan invaders destroyed it, and it is now a scene of utter desolation, as was prophesied in ( Revelation 3:14-22 ) and the extensive ruins near  Denislu  justify all that we read of Laodicea in Greek and Roman writers. Another biblical subject of interest is connected with Laodicea. From ( Colossians 4:16 ) it appears that St. Paul wrote a letter to this place when he wrote the letter to Coloss'.

On Paul's third visit to Philippi ( 20:5, 6 ) we again meet with Luke, who probably had spent all the intervening time in that city, a period of seven or eight years. From this time Luke was Paul's constant companion during his journey to Jerusalem ( 20:6-21:18 ). He again disappears from view during Paul's imprisonment at Jerusalem and Caesarea, and only reappears when Paul sets out for Rome ( 27:1 ), whither he accompanies him ( 28:2, 12-16 ), and where he remains with him till the close of his first imprisonment ( Philemon 1:24 ;  Colossians 4:14 ).

He was not born a Jew, for he is not reckoned among those \"of the circumcision\" by St. Paul. Comp. ( Colossians 4:11 ) with ver. 14. The date of his conversion is uncertain. He joined St. Paul at Troas, and shared his Journey into Macedonia. The sudden transition to the first person plural in ( Acts 16:9 ) is most naturally explained after all the objections that have been urged, by supposing that Luke the writer of the Acts, formed one of St. Paul's company from this point. As far as Philippi the evangelist journeyed with the apostle. The resumption of the third person on Paul's departure from that place, ( Acts 17:1 ) would show that Luke was now left behind. During the rest of St. Paul's second missionary journey we hear of Luke no more; but on the third journey the same indication reminds us that Luke is again of the company, ( Acts 20:5 ) having joined it apparently at Philippi, where he had been left. With the apostle he passed through Miletus, Tyre and C'sarea to Jerusalem. ch.  Acts 20:6 ;  21:18  As to his age and death there is the utmost uncertainty.

Luke 4:18 ).
