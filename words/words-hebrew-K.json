In the Bible the word does not necessarily imply great power or great extent of country. Many persons are called kings whom we should rather call chiefs or leaders. The word is applied in the Bible to God as the sovereign and ruler of the universe, and to Christ the Son of God as the head and governor of the Church. The Hebrews were ruled by a king during a period of about 500 years previous to the destruction of Jerusalem, B.C. 586. The immediate occasion of the substitution of a regal form of government for that of judges seems to have been the siege of Jabesh-gilead by Nahash king of the Ammonites. ( 1 Samuel 11:1 ;  12:12 ) The conviction seems to have forced itself on the Isr'lites that they could not resist their formidable neighbor unless they placed themselves under the sway of a king, like surrounding nations. The original idea of a Hebrew King was twofold: first, that he should lead the people to battle in time of war; and, a second, that he should execute judgment and justice to them in war and in peace. ( 1 Samuel 8:20 ) In both respects the desired end was attained. Besides being commander-in-chief of the army, supreme judge, and absolute master, as it were, of the lives of his subjects, the king exercised the power of imposing taxes on them, and of exacting from them personal service and labor. In addition to these earthly powers, the king of Isr'l had a more awful claim to respect and obedience. He was the vicegerent of Jehovah, ( 1 Samuel 10:1 ;  16:13 ) and as it were his son, if just and holy. ( 2 Samuel 7:14 ;  Psalms 2:6,7 ;  89:26,27 ) he had been set apart as a consecrated ruler. Upon his dead had been poured the holy anointing oil, which had hitherto been reserved exclusively for the priests of Jehovah. He had become, in fact, emphatically \"the Lord's anointed.\" He had a court of Oriental magnificence. The king was dressed in royal robes, ( 1 Kings 22:10 ;  2 Chronicles 18:9 ) his insignia were, a crown or diadem of pure gold, or perhaps radiant with precious gems, ( 2 Samuel 1:10 ;  12:30 ;  2 Kings 11:12 ;  Psalms 21:3 ) and a royal sceptre. Those who approached him did him obeisance, bowing down and touching the ground with their foreheads, ( 1 Samuel 24:8 ;  2 Samuel 19:24 ) and this was done even by a king's wife, the mother of Solomon. ( 1 Kings 1:16 ) His officers and subjects called themselves his servants or slaves. He had a large harem, which was guarded by eunuchs. The law of succession to the throne is somewhat obscure, but it seems most probable that the king during his lifetime named his successor. At the same time, if no partiality for a favorite wife or son intervened, there would always be a natural bias of affection in favor of the eldest son."], "Word": "King", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "24": {"Definitions": ["KING ,  noun", "1.

In the Bible the word does not necessarily imply great power or great extent of country. Many persons are called kings whom we should rather call chiefs or leaders. The word is applied in the Bible to God as the sovereign and ruler of the universe, and to Christ the Son of God as the head and governor of the Church. The Hebrews were ruled by a king during a period of about 500 years previous to the destruction of Jerusalem, B.C. 586. The immediate occasion of the substitution of a regal form of government for that of judges seems to have been the siege of Jabesh-gilead by Nahash king of the Ammonites. ( 1 Samuel 11:1 ;  12:12 ) The conviction seems to have forced itself on the Isr'lites that they could not resist their formidable neighbor unless they placed themselves under the sway of a king, like surrounding nations. The original idea of a Hebrew King was twofold: first, that he should lead the people to battle in time of war; and, a second, that he should execute judgment and justice to them in war and in peace. ( 1 Samuel 8:20 ) In both respects the desired end was attained. Besides being commander-in-chief of the army, supreme judge, and absolute master, as it were, of the lives of his subjects, the king exercised the power of imposing taxes on them, and of exacting from them personal service and labor. In addition to these earthly powers, the king of Isr'l had a more awful claim to respect and obedience. He was the vicegerent of Jehovah, ( 1 Samuel 10:1 ;  16:13 ) and as it were his son, if just and holy. ( 2 Samuel 7:14 ;  Psalms 2:6,7 ;  89:26,27 ) he had been set apart as a consecrated ruler. Upon his dead had been poured the holy anointing oil, which had hitherto been reserved exclusively for the priests of Jehovah. He had become, in fact, emphatically \"the Lord's anointed.\" He had a court of Oriental magnificence. The king was dressed in royal robes, ( 1 Kings 22:10 ;  2 Chronicles 18:9 ) his insignia were, a crown or diadem of pure gold, or perhaps radiant with precious gems, ( 2 Samuel 1:10 ;  12:30 ;  2 Kings 11:12 ;  Psalms 21:3 ) and a royal sceptre. Those who approached him did him obeisance, bowing down and touching the ground with their foreheads, ( 1 Samuel 24:8 ;  2 Samuel 19:24 ) and this was done even by a king's wife, the mother of Solomon. ( 1 Kings 1:16 ) His officers and subjects called themselves his servants or slaves. He had a large harem, which was guarded by eunuchs. The law of succession to the throne is somewhat obscure, but it seems most probable that the king during his lifetime named his successor. At the same time, if no partiality for a favorite wife or son intervened, there would always be a natural bias of affection in favor of the eldest son."], "Word": "King", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "4": {"Definitions": ["KING ,  noun", "1.

The books of Kings contain the history from David's death and Solomon's accession to the destruction of the kingdom of Judah and the desolation of Jerusalem, with a supplemental notice of an event that occurred after an interval of twenty-six years", "viz., the liberation of Jehoiachin from his prison at Babylon", "and a still further extension to Jehoiachin's death, the time of which is not known, but which was probably not long after his liberation.

In the Christian Church the kiss of charity was practiced not only as a friendly salutation, but as an act symbolical of love and Christian brotherhood. ( Romans 16:16 ;  1 Corinthians 16:20 ;  2 Corinthians 13:12 ;  1 Thessalonians 5:6 ;  1 Peter 5:14 ) It was embodied in the earlier Christian offices, and has been continued in some of those now in use. Among the Arabs the women and children kiss the beards of their husbands or fathers. The superior returns the salute by a kiss on the forehead. In Egypt an inferior kisses the hand of a superior, generally on the back, but sometimes, as a special favor, on the palm also. To testify abject submission, and in asking favors, the feet are often kissed instead of the hand. The written decrees of a sovereign are kissed in token of respect; even the ground is sometimes kissed by Orientals int he fullness of their submission. ( Genesis 41:40 ;  1 Samuel 24:8 ;  Psalms 72:9 ) etc. Kissing is spoken of in Scripture as a mark of respect or adoration to idols.

First, complaints broke out among the people, probably at the heat, the toil, and the privations of the march; and then God at once punished them by lightning, which fell on the hinder part of the camp, and killed many persons, but ceased at the intercession of Moses ( Numbers 11:1, 2 ). Then a disgust fell on the multitude at having nothing to eat but the manna day after day, no change, no flesh, no fish, no high-flavoured vegetables, no luscious fruits...The people loathed the light food,' and cried out to Moses, Give us flesh, give us flesh, that we may eat.'\" In this emergency Moses, in despair, cried unto God. An answer came. God sent \"a prodigious flight of quails, on which the people satiated their gluttonous appetite for a full month. Then punishment fell on them- they loathed the food which they had desired; it bred disease in them; the divine anger aggravated the disease into a plague, and a heavy mortality was the consequence. The dead were buried without the camp; and in memory of man's sin and of the divine wrath this name, Kibroth-hattaavah, the Graves of Lust, was given to the place of their sepulchre\" ( Numbers 11:34, 35 ;  33:16, 17 ;  Deuteronomy 9:22 ; comp.

They were wandering smiths, \"the gipsies and travelling tinkers of the old Oriental world. They formed an important guild in an age when the art of metallurgy was confined to a few\" (Sayce's Races, etc.). They showed kindness to Israel in their journey through the wilderness. They accompanied them in their march as far as Jericho ( Judges 1:16 ), and then returned to their old haunts among the Amalekites, in the desert to the south of Judah. They sustained afterwards friendly relations with the Israelites when settled in Canaan ( Judges 4:11, 17 -21;  1 Samuel 27:10 ;  30:29 ). The Rechabites belonged to this tribe ( 1 Chronicles 2:55 ) and in the days of Jeremiah ( 35:7-10 ) are referred to as following their nomad habits. Saul bade them depart from the Amalekites ( 1 Samuel 15:6 ) when, in obedience to the divine commission, he was about to \"smite Amalek.\" And his reason is, \"for ye showed kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up out of Egypt.\" Thus \"God is not unrighteous to forget the kindnesses shown to his people; but they shall be remembered another day, at the farthest in the great day, and recompensed in the resurrection of the just\" (M.

It lay in the \"wilderness\" or \"desert of Zin\" ( Genesis 14:7 ;  Numbers 13:3-26 ;  14:29-33 ;  20:1 ;  27:14 ), on the border of Edom ( 20:16 ). From this place, in compliance with the desire of the people, Moses sent forth \"twelve spies\" to spy the land. After examining it in all its districts, the spies brought back an evil report, Joshua and Caleb alone giving a good report of the land ( 13:18-31 ). Influenced by the discouraging report, the people abandoned all hope of entering into the Promised Land. They remained a considerable time at Kadesh. (See  HORMAH ;  KORAH .) Because of their unbelief, they were condemned by God to wander for thirty-eight years in the wilderness. They took their journey from Kadesh into the deserts of Paran, \"by way of the Red Sea\" ( Deuteronomy 2:1 ). (One theory is that during these thirty-eight years they remained in and about Kadesh.)", "At the end of these years of wanderings, the tribes were a second time gathered together at Kadesh. During their stay here at this time Miriam died and was buried. Here the people murmured for want of water, as their forefathers had done formerly at Rephidim; and Moses, irritated by their chidings, \"with his rod smote the rock twice,\" instead of \"speaking to the rock before their eyes,\" as the Lord had commanded him (comp.  Numbers 27:14 ;  Deuteronomy 9:23 ;  Psalms 106:32, 33 ). Because of this act of his, in which Aaron too was involved, neither of them was to be permitted to set foot within the Promised Land ( Numbers 20:12, 24 ). The king of Edom would not permit them to pass on through his territory, and therefore they commenced an eastward march, and \"came unto Mount Hor\" ( 20:22 ).", "This place has been identified with Ain el-Kadeis, about 12 miles east-south-east of Beersheba.

Barnea means,  desert of wandering. ) This place, the scene of Miriam's death, was the farthest point which the Isr'lites reached in their direct road to Canaan; it was also that whence the spies were sent, and where, on their return, the people broke out into murmuring, upon which their strictly penal term of wandering began. ( Numbers 13:3,26 ;  14:29-33 ;  20:1 ;  2:14 ) It is probable that the term \"Kadesh,\" though applied to signify a \"city,\" yet had also a wider application to a region in which Kadesh-meribah certainly, and Kadesh-barnea probably, indicates a precise spot. In ( Genesis 14:7 ) Kadesh is identified with En-mishpat, the \"fountain of judgment.\" It has been supposed, from ( Numbers 13:21,26 ) and  Numbers 20:1  ... that there were two places of the name of Kadesh, one in the wilderness of Paran and the other in that of Zin; but it is more probable that only one place is meant, and that Zin is but a part of the great desert of Paran. (There has been much doubt as to the exact site of Kadesh; but Rev. H. Clay Trumbull of Philadelphia, visiting the spot in 1881, succeeded in rendering almost certain that the site of Kadesh is  Ain Kadis  (spelled also  Gadis  and  Quadis ); \"the very same name, letter for letter in Arabic and Hebrew, with the scriptural fountain of Kadesh", "the 'holy fountain,' as the name means", "which gushed forth when Moses smote the rock.\" It lies 40 miles south of Beersheba and 165 northeast of Horeb, immediately below the southern border of Palestine. It was discovered in 1842 by the Rev. J. Rowlands of Queen's College, Cambridge, England, whose discovery was endorsed by the great German geographer Ritter, by E.S. Palmer in his \"Desert of the Exodus,\" and by the \"Imperial Bible Dictionary.\" Dr. Trumbull thus describes it:", "\"It is an extensive oasis, a series of wells, the water of which flows out from under such an overhanging cliff as is mentioned in the Bible story; and it opens into a vast plain or wadi large enough to have furnished a camping-ground for the whole host of Isr'l. Extensive primitive ruins are on the hills near it. The plain or wadi, also called Quadis, is shut in by surrounding hills so as to make it a most desirable position for such a people as the Isr'lites on the borders of hostile territory", "such a position as leaders like Moses and Joshua would have been likely to select.\" \"It was carpeted with grass and flowers. Fig treed laden with fruit were against its limestone hillsides. Shrubs in richness and variety abounded. Standing out from the mountain range at the northward of the beautiful oasis amphitheater was the 'large single mass or small hill of solid rock' which Rowlands looked at as the cliff (sela) smitten by Moses to cause it to 'give forth its water' when its flowing had ceased. From beneath this cliff came the abundant stream. A well, walled up with timeworn limestone blocks, was the first receptacle of the water. Not far from this was a second well similarly walled, supplied from the same source. Around both these wells were ancient watering-troughs of limestone. Several pools, not walled up, where also supplied from the stream. The water was clear and sweet and abundant. Two of the pools were ample for bathing.\"", "ED.)"], "Word": "Kadesh, Kadeshbarnea", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "6": {"Definitions": ["holiness of an inconstant son"], "Word": "Kadesh-barnea", "Dictionary": "Hitchcock's Names Dictionary"}}}
