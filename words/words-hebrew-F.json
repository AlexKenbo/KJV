For sacred purposes. The sacrifices were consumed by fire ( Genesis 8:20 ). The ever-burning fire on the altar was first kindled from heaven ( Leviticus 6:9, 13 ;  9:24 ), and afterwards rekindled at the dedication of Solomon's temple ( 2 Chronicles 7:1, 3 ). The expressions \"fire from heaven\" and \"fire of the Lord\" generally denote lightning, but sometimes also the fire of the altar was so called ( Exodus 29:18 ;  Leviticus 1:9 ;  2:3 ;  3:5, 9 ).", "Fire for a sacred purpose obtained otherwise than from the altar was called \"strange fire\" ( Leviticus 10:1, 2 ;  Numbers 3:4 ).", "The victims slain for sin offerings were afterwards consumed by fire outside the camp ( Leviticus 4:12, 21 ;  6:30 ;  16:27 ;  Hebrews 13:11 ).", "2.  For domestic purposes, such as baking, cooking, warmth, etc. ( Jeremiah 36:22 ;  Mark 14:54 ;  John 18:18 ). But on Sabbath no fire for any domestic purpose was to be kindled ( Exodus 35:3 ;  Numbers 15:32-36 ).", "3.  Punishment of death by fire was inflicted on such as were guilty of certain forms of unchastity and incest ( Leviticus 20:14 ;  21:9 ). The burning of captives in war was not unknown among the Jews ( 2 Samuel 12:31 ;  Jeremiah 29:22 ). The bodies of infamous persons who were executed were also sometimes burned ( Joshua 7:25 ;  2 Kings 23:16 ).", "4.  In war, fire was used in the destruction of cities, as Jericho ( Joshua 6:24 ), Ai ( 8:19 ), Hazor ( 11:11 ), Laish ( Judges 18:27 ), etc. The war-chariots of the Canaanites were burnt ( Joshua 11:6, 9, 13 ). The Israelites burned the images ( 2 Kings 10:26 ; R.V., \"pillars\") of the house of Baal. These objects of worship seem to have been of the nature of obelisks, and were sometimes evidently made of wood.", "Torches were sometimes carried by the soldiers in battle ( Judges 7:16 ).", "5.

The use of animal food was probably not unknown to the antediluvians. There is, however, a distinct law on the subject given to Noah after the Deluge ( Genesis 9:2-5) . Various articles of food used in the patriarchal age are mentioned in  Genesis 18:6-8;   25:34 ;  27:3, 4 ;  43:11 . Regarding the food of the Israelites in Egypt, see  Exodus 16:3 ;  Numbers 11:5 . In the wilderness their ordinary food was miraculously supplied in the manna. They had also quails ( Exodus 16:11-13 ;  Numbers 11:31 ).", "In the law of Moses there are special regulations as to the animals to be used for food ( Leviticus 11 ;  Deuteronomy 14:3-21 ). The Jews were also forbidden to use as food anything that had been consecrated to idols ( Exodus 34:15 ), or animals that had died of disease or had been torn by wild beasts ( Exodus 22:31 ;  Leviticus 22:8 ). (See also for other restrictions  Exodus 23:19 ;  29:13-22 ;  Leviticus 3:4-9;   9:18, 19 ;  22:8 ;  Deuteronomy 14:21 .) But beyond these restrictions they had a large grant from God ( Deuteronomy 14:26 ;  32:13, 14 ).", "Food was prepared for use in various ways. The cereals were sometimes eaten without any preparation ( Leviticus 23:14 ;  Deuteronomy 23:25 ;  2 Kings 4:42 ).

Vegetable food was more used than animal. The Hebrews used a great variety of articles, ( John 21:5 ) to give a relish to bread. Milk and its preparations hold a conspicuous place in eastern diet, as affording substantial nourishment; generally int he form of the modern  leben  , i.e. sour milk. Authorized Version \"butter;\" ( Genesis 18:8 ;  Judges 5:25 ;  2 Samuel 17:29 ) Fruit was another source of subsistence- figs stood first in point of importance; they were generally dried and pressed into cakes. Grapes were generally eaten in a dried state as raisins. Of vegetables we have most frequent notice of lentils, beans, leeks, onions and garlic, which were and still are of a superior quality in Egypt. ( Numbers 11:5 ) Honey is extensively used, as is also olive oil. The Orientals have been at all times sparing in the use of animal food; not only does the extensive head of the climate render it both unwholesome to eat much meat and expensive from the necessity of immediately consuming a whole animal, but beyond this the ritual regulations of the Mosaic law in ancient, as of the Koran in modern, times have tended to the same result. The prohibition expressed against consuming the blood of any animal, ( Genesis 9:4 ) was more fully developed in the Levitical law, and enforced by the penalty of death. ( Leviticus 3:17 ;  7:26 ;  19:26 ;  12:16 ) Certain portions of the fat of sacrifices were also forbidden, ( Leviticus 3:9,10 ) as being set apart for the altar, ( Leviticus 3:16 ;  7:25 ) In addition to the above, Christians were forbidden to eat the flesh of animals portions of which had been offered to idols. All beasts and birds classed as unclean, ( Leviticus 11:1 ) ff.;  Deuteronomy 14:4  ff., were also prohibited. Under these restrictions the Hebrews were permitted the free use of animal food- generally speaking they only availed themselves of it in the exercise of hospitality or at festivals of a religious, public or private character. It was only in royal households that there was a daily consumption of meat. The animals killed for meat were", "calves, lambs, oxen not above three years of age, harts, roebucks and fallow deer; birds of various kinds; fish, with the exception of such as were without scales and fins. Locusts, of which certain species only were esteemed clean, were occasionally eaten, ( Matthew 3:4 ) but were regarded as poor fare."], "Word": "Food", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "4": {"Definitions": ["FOOD ,  noun   [ See Feed .]", "1.

Its primary idea is trust. A thing is true, and therefore worthy of trust. It admits of many degrees up to full assurance of faith, in accordance with the evidence on which it rests.", "Faith is the result of teaching ( Romans 10:14-17 ). Knowledge is an essential element in all faith, and is sometimes spoken of as an equivalent to faith ( John 10:38 ;  1 John 2:3 ). Yet the two are distinguished in this respect, that faith includes in it assent, which is an act of the will in addition to the act of the understanding. Assent to the truth is of the essence of faith, and the ultimate ground on which our assent to any revealed truth rests is the veracity of God.", "Historical faith is the apprehension of and assent to certain statements which are regarded as mere facts of history.", "Temporary faith is that state of mind which is awakened in men (e.g., Felix) by the exhibition of the truth and by the influence of religious sympathy, or by what is sometimes styled the common operation of the Holy Spirit.", "Saving faith is so called because it has eternal life inseparably connected with it. It cannot be better defined than in the words of the Assembly's Shorter Catechism- \"Faith in Jesus Christ is a saving grace, whereby we receive and rest upon him alone for salvation, as he is offered to us in the gospel.\"", "The object of saving faith is the whole revealed Word of God. Faith accepts and believes it as the very truth most sure. But the special act of faith which unites to Christ has as its object the person and the work of the Lord Jesus Christ ( John 7:38 ;  Acts 16:31 ). This is the specific act of faith by which a sinner is justified before God ( Romans 3:22, 25 ;  Galatians 2:16 ;  Philippians 3:9 ;  John 3:16-36 ;  Acts 10:43 ;  16:31 ). In this act of faith the believer appropriates and rests on Christ alone as Mediator in all his offices.", "This assent to or belief in the truth received upon the divine testimony has always associated with it a deep sense of sin, a distinct view of Christ, a consenting will, and a loving heart, together with a reliance on, a trusting in, or resting in Christ. It is that state of mind in which a poor sinner, conscious of his sin, flees from his guilty self to Christ his Saviour, and rolls over the burden of all his sins on him. It consists chiefly, not in the assent given to the testimony of God in his Word, but in embracing with fiducial reliance and trust the one and only Saviour whom God reveals. This trust and reliance is of the essence of faith. By faith the believer directly and immediately appropriates Christ as his own. Faith in its direct act makes Christ ours. It is not a work which God graciously accepts instead of perfect obedience, but is only the hand by which we take hold of the person and work of our Redeemer as the only ground of our salvation.", "Saving faith is a moral act, as it proceeds from a renewed will, and a renewed will is necessary to believing assent to the truth of God ( 1 Corinthians 2:14 ;  2 Corinthians 4:4 ). Faith, therefore, has its seat in the moral part of our nature fully as much as in the intellectual. The mind must first be enlightened by divine teaching ( John 6:44 ;  Acts 13:48 ;  2 Corinthians 4:6 ;  Ephesians 1:17, 18 ) before it can discern the things of the Spirit.", "Faith is necessary to our salvation ( Mark 16:16 ), not because there is any merit in it, but simply because it is the sinner's taking the place assigned him by God, his falling in with what God is doing.", "The warrant or ground of faith is the divine testimony, not the reasonableness of what God says, but the simple fact that he says it. Faith rests immediately on, \"Thus saith the Lord.\" But in order to this faith the veracity, sincerity, and truth of God must be owned and appreciated, together with his unchangeableness. God's word encourages and emboldens the sinner personally to transact with Christ as God's gift, to close with him, embrace him, give himself to Christ, and take Christ as his. That word comes with power, for it is the word of God who has revealed himself in his works, and especially in the cross. God is to be believed for his word's sake, but also for his name's sake.", "Faith in Christ secures for the believer freedom from condemnation, or justification before God; a participation in the life that is in Christ, the divine life ( John 14:19 ;  Romans 6:4-10 ;  Ephesians 4:15, 16 , etc.); \"peace with God\" ( Romans 5:1 ); and sanctification ( Acts 26:18 ;  Galatians 5:6 ;  Acts 15:9 ).", "All who thus believe in Christ will certainly be saved ( John 6:37, 40 ;

Most of the former have the opening of the gills closed by a peculiar covering, called the gill-lid; many of the latter have no gill-lid, and are hence said to breathe through apertures. Cetaceous animals, as the whale and dolphin, are, in popular language, called fishes, and have been so classed by some naturalists; but they breathe by lungs, and are viviparous, like quadrupeds.

If man had never fallen there would have been no opportunity of showing divine mercy. But by permitting evil, mysterious as it seems, God's works of grace, mercy, and wisdom in saving sinners have been wonderfully manifested to all his creatures.

If therefore the heavy rains of November and December fail, the sustenance of the people is cut off in the parching drought of harvest-time, when the country is almost devoid of moisture. Egypt, again, owes all its fertility to its mighty river, whose annual rise inundates nearly the whole land. The causes of dearth and famine in Egypt are defective inundation, preceded, accompanied and followed by prevalent easterly and southerly winds. Famine is likewise a natural result in the East when caterpillars, locusts or other insects destroy the products of the earth. The first famine recorded in the Bible is that of Abraham after he had pitched his tent on the east of Bethel, ( Genesis 12:10 ) the second in the days of Isaac, ( Genesis 26:1 ) seq. We hear no more of times of scarcity until the great famine of Egypt, which \"was over all the face of the earth.\" ( Genesis 41:53-57 ) The modern history of Egypt throws some curious light on these ancient records of famines; and instances of their recurrence may be cited to assist us in understanding their course and extent. The most remarkable famine was that of the reign of the Fatimee Khaleefeh, El-Mustansir billah, which is the only instance on record of one of seven years duration in Egypt since the time of Joseph (A.H. 457-464, A.D. 1064-1071). Vehement drought and pestilence continued for seven consecutive years, so that the people ate corpses, and animals that died of themselves. The famine of Samaria resembled it in many particulars; and that very briefly recorded in ( 2 Kings 8:1,2 ) affords another instance of one of seven years.

It is obtained by successive incisions in the bark of a tree called  Arbor thuris  . The first incision yields the purest and whitest resin, while the product of the after incisions is spotted with yellow, and loses its whiteness altogether as it becomes old. The Hebrews imported their frankincense from Arabia, ( Isaiah 60:6 ;  Jeremiah 6:20 ) and more particularly from Saba; but it is remarkable that at present the Arabian libanum or olibanum is a very inferior kind, and that the finest frankincense imported into Turkey comes through Arabia from the islands of the Indian Archipelago.

All the perennial rivers and streams of the country are supplied from fountains, and depend comparatively little on surface water. \"Palestine is a country of mountains and hills, and it abounds in fountains of water. The murmur of these waters is heard in every dell, and the luxuriant foliage which surrounds them is seen in every plain.\" Besides its rain-water, its cisterns and fountains, Jerusalem had also an abundant supply of water in the magnificent reservoir called \"Solomon's Pools\" (q.v.), at the head of the Urtas valley, whence it was conveyed to the city by subterrean channels some 10 miles in length. These have all been long ago destroyed, so that no water from the \"Pools\" now reaches Jerusalem.

The fig-tree is mentioned ( Deuteronomy 8:8 ) as one of the valuable products of Palestine. It was a sign of peace and prosperity ( 1 Kings 4:25 ;  Micah 4:4 ;  Zechariah 3:10 ). Figs were used medicinally ( 2 Kings 20:7 ), and pressed together and formed into \"cakes\" as articles of diet ( 1 Samuel 30:12 ;  Jeremiah 24:2 ).", "Our Lord's cursing the fig-tree near Bethany ( Mark 11:13 ) has occasioned much perplexity from the circumstance, as mentioned by the evangelist, that \"the time of figs was not yet.\" The explanation of the words, however, lies in the simple fact that the fruit of the fig-tree appears before the leaves, and hence that if the tree produced leaves it ought also to have had fruit.
