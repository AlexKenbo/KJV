These commandments were first given in their written form to the people of Israel when they were encamped at Sinai, about fifty days after they came out of Egypt ( Exodus 19:10-25 ). They were written by the finger of God on two tables of stone. The first tables were broken by Moses when he brought them down from the mount ( 32:19 ), being thrown by him on the ground. At the command of God he took up into the mount two other tables, and God wrote on them \"the words that were on the first tables\" ( 34:1 ). These tables were afterwards placed in the ark of the covenant ( Deuteronomy 10:5 ;  1 Kings 8:9 ). Their subsequent history is unknown. They are as a whole called \"the covenant\" ( Deuteronomy 4:13 ), and \"the tables of the covenant\" ( 9:9, 11 ;  Hebrews 9:4 ), and \"the testimony.\"", "They are obviously \"ten\" in number, but their division is not fixed, hence different methods of numbering them have been adopted. The Jews make the \"Preface\" one of the commandments, and then combine the first and second. The Roman Catholics and Lutherans combine the first and second and divide the tenth into two. The Jews and Josephus divide them equally. The Lutherans and Roman Catholics refer three commandments to the first table and seven to the second. The Greek and Reformed Churches refer four to the first and six to the second table. The Samaritans add to the second that Gerizim is the mount of worship.

These commandments were first given in their written form to the people of Israel when they were encamped at Sinai, about fifty days after they came out of Egypt ( Exodus 19:10-25 ). They were written by the finger of God on two tables of stone. The first tables were broken by Moses when he brought them down from the mount ( 32:19 ), being thrown by him on the ground. At the command of God he took up into the mount two other tables, and God wrote on them \"the words that were on the first tables\" ( 34:1 ). These tables were afterwards placed in the ark of the covenant ( Deuteronomy 10:5 ;  1 Kings 8:9 ). Their subsequent history is unknown. They are as a whole called \"the covenant\" ( Deuteronomy 4:13 ), and \"the tables of the covenant\" ( 9:9, 11 ;  Hebrews 9:4 ), and \"the testimony.\"", "They are obviously \"ten\" in number, but their division is not fixed, hence different methods of numbering them have been adopted. The Jews make the \"Preface\" one of the commandments, and then combine the first and second. The Roman Catholics and Lutherans combine the first and second and divide the tenth into two. The Jews and Josephus divide them equally. The Lutherans and Roman Catholics refer three commandments to the first table and seven to the second. The Greek and Reformed Churches refer four to the first and six to the second table. The Samaritans add to the second that Gerizim is the mount of worship.

These commandments were first given in their written form to the people of Israel when they were encamped at Sinai, about fifty days after they came out of Egypt ( Exodus 19:10-25 ). They were written by the finger of God on two tables of stone. The first tables were broken by Moses when he brought them down from the mount ( 32:19 ), being thrown by him on the ground. At the command of God he took up into the mount two other tables, and God wrote on them \"the words that were on the first tables\" ( 34:1 ). These tables were afterwards placed in the ark of the covenant ( Deuteronomy 10:5 ;  1 Kings 8:9 ). Their subsequent history is unknown. They are as a whole called \"the covenant\" ( Deuteronomy 4:13 ), and \"the tables of the covenant\" ( 9:9, 11 ;  Hebrews 9:4 ), and \"the testimony.\"", "They are obviously \"ten\" in number, but their division is not fixed, hence different methods of numbering them have been adopted. The Jews make the \"Preface\" one of the commandments, and then combine the first and second. The Roman Catholics and Lutherans combine the first and second and divide the tenth into two. The Jews and Josephus divide them equally. The Lutherans and Roman Catholics refer three commandments to the first table and seven to the second. The Greek and Reformed Churches refer four to the first and six to the second table. The Samaritans add to the second that Gerizim is the mount of worship.

Jabin, the king of Canaan, had 900 chariots ( Judges 4:3 ); and in Saul's time the Philistines had 30,000. In his wars with the king of Zobah and with the Syrians, David took many chariots among the spoils ( 2 Samuel 8:4 ;  10:18 ). Solomon maintained as part of his army 1,400 chariots ( 1 Kings 10:26 ), which were chiefly imported from Egypt ( 29 ).

The Jewish chariots were patterned after the Egyptian, and consisted of a single pair of wheels on an axle, upon which was a car with high front and sides, but open at the back. The earliest mention of chariots in Scripture is in Egypt, where Joseph, as a mark of distinction, was placed in Pharaoh's second chariot. ( Genesis 41:43 ) Later on we find mention of Egyptian chariots for a warlike purpose. ( Exodus 14:7 ) In this point of view chariots among some nations of antiquity, as elephants among others, may be regarded as filling the place of heavy artillery in modern times, so that the military power of a nation might be estimated by the number of its chariots. Thus Pharaoh in pursuing Isr'l took with him 600 chariots. The Philistines in Saul's time had 30,000. ( 1 Samuel 13:5 ) David took from Hadadezer, king of Zobah, 1000 chariots, ( 2 Samuel 8:4 ) and from the Syrians a little later 700, ( 2 Samuel 10:18 ) who in order to recover their ground, collected 32,000 chariots. ( 1 Chronicles 19:7 ) Up to this time the Isr'lites possessed few or no chariots. They were first introduced by David, ( 2 Samuel 8:4 ) who raised and maintained a force of 1400 chariots, ( 1 Kings 10:25 ) by taxation on certain cities agreeably to eastern custom in such matters. ( 1 Kings 9:19 ;  10:25 ) From this time chariots were regarded as among the most important arms of war. ( 1 Kings 22:34 ;  2 Kings 9:16,21 ;  13:7,14 ;  18:24 ;  23:30 ;  Isaiah 31:1 ) Most commonly two persons, and sometimes three, rode in the chariot, of whom the third was employed to carry the state umbrella. ( 1 Kings 22:34 ;  2 Kings 9:20,24 ;  Acts 8:38 ) The prophets allude frequently to chariots as typical of power.

When the  comet  is westward of the sun and rises or sets before it, the light appears in the morning like a train beginning at the body of the  comet  and extending westward and diverging in proportion to its extent. Thus the  comet  of 1769, [which I saw, ] when it rose in the morning, presented a luminous train that extended nearly from the horizon to the meridian. When the  comet  and the sun are opposite, the earth being between them, the  comet  is, to the view, immersed in its train and the light appears around its body like a fringe or border of hair.

Mention is made of the camel among the cattle given by Pharaoh to Abraham ( Genesis 12:16 ). Its flesh was not to be eaten, as it was ranked among unclean animals ( Leviticus 11:4 ;  Deuteronomy 14:7 ). Abraham's servant rode on a camel when he went to fetch a wife for Isaac ( Genesis 24:10, 11 ). Jacob had camels as a portion of his wealth ( 30:43 ), as Abraham also had ( 24:35 ). He sent a present of thirty milch camels to his brother Esau ( 32:15 ). It appears to have been little in use among the Jews after the conquest. It is, however, mentioned in the history of David ( 1 Chronicles 27:30 ), and after the Exile ( Ezra 2:67 ;  Nehemiah 7:69 ). Camels were much in use among other nations in the East. The queen of Sheba came with a caravan of camels when she came to see the wisdom of Solomon ( 1 Kings 10:2 ;  2 Chronicles 9:1 ). Benhadad of Damascus also sent a present to Elisha, \"forty camels' burden\" ( 2 Kings 8:9 ).", "To show the difficulty in the way of a rich man's entering into the kingdom, our Lord uses the proverbial expression that it was easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle ( Matthew 19:24 ).", "To strain at (rather, out) a gnat and swallow a camel was also a proverbial expression ( Matthew 23:24 ), used with reference to those who were careful to avoid small faults, and yet did not hesitate to commit the greatest sins. The Jews carefully filtered their wine before drinking it, for fear of swallowing along with it some insect forbidden in the law as unclean, and yet they omitted openly the \"weightier matters\" of the law.", "The raiment worn by John the Baptist was made of camel's hair ( Matthew 3:4 ;  Mark 1:6 ), by which he was distinguished from those who resided in royal palaces and wore soft raiment. This was also the case with Elijah ( 2 Kings 1:8 ), who is called \"a hairy man,\" from his wearing such raiment. \"This is one of the most admirable materials for clothing; it keeps out the heat, cold, and rain.\" The \"sackcloth\" so often alluded to ( 2 Kings 1:8 ;  Isaiah 15:3 ;  Zechariah 13:4 , etc.) was probably made of camel's hair."], "Word": "Camel", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "3": {"Definitions": ["Herds of Genesis 12:16 ;  Genesis 24:35 ;  Genesis 30:43 ;  1 Samuel 30:17 ;  1 Chronicles 27:30 ;  Job 1:3 ;  Job 1:17 ;  Isaiah 60:6", "Docility of Genesis 24:11", "Uses of:", "For riding Genesis 24:10 ;  Genesis 24:61 ;  Genesis 24:64 ;  Genesis 31:17", "For posts Esther 8:10 ;  Esther 8:14 ;  Jeremiah 2:23", "For drawing chariots Isaiah 21:7", "For carrying burdens Genesis 24:10 ;  Genesis 37:25 ;  1 Kings 10:2 ;  2 Kings 8:9 ;  1 Chronicles 12:40 ;  Isaiah 30:6", "For cavalry 1 Samuel 30:17", "For milk Genesis 32:15", "Forbidden as food Leviticus 11:4", "Hair of, made into cloth Matthew 3:4 ;  Mark 1:6", "Ornaments of Judges 8:21 ;  Judges 8:26", "Stables for Ezekiel 25:5"], "Word": "Camel", "Dictionary": "Naves Topical Index"}, "4": {"Definitions": ["The species of camel which was in common use among the Jews and the heathen nations of Palestine was the Arabian or one-humped camel,  Camelus arabicus  .

The speed, of the dromedary has been greatly exaggerated, the Arabs asserting that it is swifter than the horse. Eight or nine miles an hour is the utmost it is able to perform; this pace, however, it is able to keep up for hours together. The Arabian camel carries about 500 pounds. \"The hump on the camel's back is chiefly a store of fat, from which the animal draws as the wants of his system require; and the Arab is careful to see that the hump is in good condition before a long journey. Another interesting adaptation is the thick sole which protects the foot of the camel from the burning sand. The nostrils may be closed by valves against blasts of sand. Most interesting is the provision for drought made by providing the second stomach with great cells in which water is long retained.

They may be classified as,", "1.  Neat cattle. Many hundreds of these were yearly consumed in sacrifices or used for food. The finest herds were found in Bashan, beyond Jordan ( Numbers 32:4 ). Large herds also pastured on the wide fertile plains of Sharon. They were yoked to the plough ( 1 Kings 19:19 ), and were employed for carrying burdens ( 1 Chronicles 12:40 ). They were driven with a pointed rod ( Judges 3:31 ) or goad (q.v.).", "According to the Mosaic law, the mouths of cattle employed for the threshing-floor were not to be muzzled, so as to prevent them from eating of the provender over which they trampled ( Deuteronomy 25:4 ). Whosoever stole and sold or slaughtered an ox must give five in satisfaction ( Exodus 22:1 ); but if it was found alive in the possession of him who stole it, he was required to make double restitution only ( 22:4 ). If an ox went astray, whoever found it was required to bring it back to its owner ( 23:4 ;  Deuteronomy 22:1, 4 ). An ox and an ass could not be yoked together in the plough ( Deuteronomy 22:10 ).", "2.  Small cattle. Next to herds of neat cattle, sheep formed the most important of the possessions of the inhabitants of Palestine ( Genesis 12:16 ;  13:5 ;  26:14 ;  21:27 ;  29:2, 3 ). They are frequently mentioned among the booty taken in war ( Numbers 31:32 ;  Joshua 6:21 ;  1 Samuel 14:32 ;  15:3 ). There were many who were owners of large flocks ( 1 Samuel 25:2 ;  2 Samuel 12:2 , comp.  Job 1:3 ). Kings also had shepherds \"over their flocks\" ( 1 Chronicles 27:31 ), from which they derived a large portion of their revenue ( 2 Samuel 17:29 ;  1 Chronicles 12:40 ). The districts most famous for their flocks of sheep were the plain of Sharon ( Isaiah 65:10 ), Mount Carmel ( Micah 7:14 ), Bashan and Gilead ( Micah 7:14 ). In patriarchal times the flocks of sheep were sometimes tended by the daughters of the owners. Thus Rachel, the daughter of Laban, kept her father's sheep ( Genesis 29:9 ); as also Zipporah and her six sisters had charge of their father Jethro's flocks ( Exodus 2:16 ). Sometimes they were kept by hired shepherds ( John 10:12 ), and sometimes by the sons of the family ( 1 Samuel 16:11 ;  17:15 ). The keepers so familiarized their sheep with their voices that they knew them, and followed them at their call. Sheep, but more especially rams and lambs, were frequently offered in sacrifice. The shearing of sheep was a great festive occasion ( 1 Samuel 25:4 ;  2 Samuel 13:23 ). They were folded at night, and guarded by their keepers against the attacks of the lion ( Micah 5:8 ), the bear ( 1 Samuel 17:34 ), and the wolf ( Matthew 10:16 ;  John 10:12 ). They were liable to wander over the wide pastures and go astray ( Psalms 119:176 ;  Isaiah 53:6 ;  Hosea 4:16 ;  Matthew 18:12 ).", "Goats also formed a part of the pastoral wealth of Palestine ( Genesis 15:9 ;  32:14 ;  37:31 ).

( Ezekiel 16:4 ;  Job 38:9 ;  Luke 2:7 ) On the 8th day the rite of circumcision, in the case of a boy, was performed and a name given. At the end of a certain time (forty days if a son and twice as long if a daughter) the mother offered sacrifice for her cleansing. ( Leviticus 12:1-8 ;  Luke 2:22 ) The period of nursing appears to have been sometimes prolonged to three years. ( Isaiah 49:15 ) 2 Macc. 7.27. The time of weaning was an occasion of rejoicing. ( Genesis 21:8 ) Both boys and girls in their early years were under the care of the women. ( Proverbs 31:1 ) Afterwards the boys were taken by the father under his charge. Daughters usually remained in the women's apartments till marriage. ( Leviticus 21:9 ;  Numbers 12:14 ;  1 Samuel 9:11 ) The authority of parents, especially of the father, over children was very great, as was also the reverence enjoined by the law to be paid to parents.

In the Old Testament the Hebrew word berith is always thus translated. Berith is derived from a root which means \"to cut,\" and hence a covenant is a \"cutting,\" with reference to the cutting or dividing of animals into two parts, and the contracting parties passing between them, in making a covenant (Genesis 15;  Jeremiah 34:18, 19 ).", "The corresponding word in the New Testament Greek is diatheke, which is, however, rendered \"testament\" generally in the Authorized Version. It ought to be rendered, just as the word berith of the Old Testament, \"covenant.\"", "This word is used (1) of a covenant or compact between man and man ( Genesis 21:32 ), or between tribes or nations ( 1 Samuel 11:1 ;  Joshua 9:6, 15 ). In entering into a convenant, Jehovah was solemnly called on to witness the transaction ( Genesis 31:50 ), and hence it was called a \"covenant of the Lord\" ( 1 Samuel 20:8 ). The marriage compact is called \"the covenant of God\" ( Proverbs 2:17 ), because the marriage was made in God's name. Wicked men are spoken of as acting as if they had made a \"covenant with death\" not to destroy them, or with hell not to devour them ( Isaiah 28:15, 18 ).", "2.  The word is used with reference to God's revelation of himself in the way of promise or of favour to men. Thus God's promise to Noah after the Flood is called a covenant (Genesis 9;  Jeremiah 33:20 , \"my covenant\"). We have an account of God's covernant with Abraham (Genesis 17, comp.  Leviticus 26:42 ), of the covenant of the priesthood ( Numbers 25:12, 13 ;  Deuteronomy 33:9 ;  Nehemiah 13:29 ), and of the covenant of Sinai ( Exodus 34:27, 28 ;  Leviticus 26:15 ), which was afterwards renewed at different times in the history of Israel (Deuteronomy 29;  Joshua 1:24 ; 2 Chronicles 15; 23; 29; 34; Ezra 10; Nehemiah 9). In conformity with human custom, God's covenant is said to be confirmed with an oath ( Deuteronomy 4:31 ;  Psalms 89:3 ), and to be accompanied by a sign (Genesis 9; 17). Hence the covenant is called God's \"counsel,\" \"oath,\" \"promise\" ( Psalms 89:3, 4 ;  105:8 -11;  Hebrews 6:13-20 ;  Luke 1:68-75 ). God's covenant consists wholly in the bestowal of blessing ( Isaiah 59:21 ;  Jeremiah 31:33, 34 ).", "The term covenant is also used to designate the regular succession of day and night ( Jeremiah 33:20 ), the Sabbath ( Exodus 31:16 ), circumcision ( Genesis 17:9, 10 ), and in general any ordinance of God ( Jeremiah 34:13, 14 ).", "A \"covenant of salt\" signifies an everlasting covenant, in the sealing or ratifying of which salt, as an emblem of perpetuity, is used ( Numbers 18:19 ;  Leviticus 2:13 ;  2 Chronicles 13:5 ).", "COVENANT OF WORKS, the constitution under which Adam was placed at his creation. In this covenant,", "1.  The contracting parties were (a) God the moral Governor, and (b) Adam, a free moral agent, and representative of all his natural posterity ( Romans 5:12-19 ).", "2.  The promise was \"life\" ( Matthew 19:16, 17 ;  Galatians 3:12 ).", "3.  The condition was perfect obedience to the law, the test in this case being abstaining from eating the fruit of the \"tree of knowledge,\" etc.", "4.  The penalty was death ( Genesis 2:16, 17 ).", "This covenant is also called a covenant of nature, as made with man in his natural or unfallen state; a covenant of life, because \"life\" was the promise attached to obedience; and a legal covenant, because it demanded perfect obedience to the law.", "The \"tree of life\" was the outward sign and seal of that life which was promised in the covenant, and hence it is usually called the seal of that covenant.", "This covenant is abrogated under the gospel, inasmuch as Christ has fulfilled all its conditions in behalf of his people, and now offers salvation on the condition of faith. It is still in force, however, as it rests on the immutable justice of God, and is binding on all who have not fled to Christ and accepted his righteousness.", "COVENANT OF GRACE, the eternal plan of redemption entered into by the three persons of the Godhead, and carried out by them in its several parts. In it the Father represented the Godhead in its indivisible sovereignty, and the Son his people as their surety ( John 17:4, 6, 9 ;  Isaiah 42:6 ;  Psalms 89:3 ).", "The conditions of this covenant were,", "1.  On the part of the Father (a) all needful preparation to the Son for the accomplishment of his work ( Hebrews 10:5 ;  Isaiah 42:1-7) ; (b) support in the work ( Luke 22:43 ); and (c) a glorious reward in the exaltation of Christ when his work was done ( Philippians 2:6-11 ), his investiture with universal dominion ( John 5:22 ;  Psalms 110:1 ), his having the administration of the covenant committed into his hands ( Matthew 28:18 ;  John 1:12 ;  17:2 ;  Acts 2:33 ), and in the final salvation of all his people ( Isaiah 35:10 ;  53:10, 11 ;  Jeremiah 31:33 ;  Titus 1:2 ).", "2.  On the part of the Son the conditions were (a) his becoming incarnate ( Galatians 4:4, 5 ); and (b) as the second Adam his representing all his people, assuming their place and undertaking all their obligations under the violated covenant of works; (c) obeying the law ( Psalms 40:8 ;  Isaiah 42:21 ;  John 9:4, 5 ), and (d) suffering its penalty (Isaiah 53;  2 Corinthians 5:21 ;  Galatians 3:13 ), in their stead.", "Christ, the mediator of, fulfils all its conditions in behalf of his people, and dispenses to them all its blessings.

Of Israel. The kingdom of the ten tribes was successively invaded by several Assyrian kings. Pul (q.v.) imposed a tribute on Menahem of a thousand talents of silver ( 2 Kings 15:19, 20 ;  1 Chronicles 5:26 ) (B.C. 762), and Tiglath-pileser, in the days of Pekah (B.C. 738), carried away the trans-Jordanic tribes and the inhabitants of Galilee into Assyria ( 2 Kings 15:29 ;  Isaiah 9:1 ). Subsequently Shalmaneser invaded Israel and laid siege to Samaria, the capital of the kingdom. During the siege he died, and was succeeded by Sargon, who took the city, and transported the great mass of the people into Assyria (B.C. 721), placing them in Halah and in Habor, and in the cities of the Medes ( 2 Kings 17:3, 5 ). Samaria was never again inhabited by the Israelites. The families thus removed were carried to distant cities, many of them not far from the Caspian Sea, and their place was supplied by colonists from Babylon and Cuthah, etc. ( 2 Kings 17:24 ). Thus terminated the kingdom of the ten tribes, after a separate duration of two hundred and fifty-five years (B.C. 975-721).", "Many speculations have been indulged in with reference to these ten tribes. But we believe that all, except the number that probably allied themselves with Judah and shared in their restoration under Cyrus, are finally lost.", "\"Like the dew on the mountain, Like the foam on the river, Like the bubble on the fountain, They are gone, and for ever.\"", "2.  Of Judah. In the third year of Jehoiachim, the eighteenth king of Judah (B.C. 605), Nebuchadnezzar having overcome the Egyptians at Carchemish, advanced to Jerusalem with a great army. After a brief siege he took that city, and carried away the vessels of the sanctuary to Babylon, and dedicated them in the Temple of Belus ( 2 Kings 24:1 ;  2 Chronicles 36:6, 7 ;  Daniel 1:1, 2 ). He also carried away the treasures of the king, whom he made his vassal. At this time, from which is dated the \"seventy years\" of captivity ( Jeremiah 25 ;  Daniel 9:1, 2 ), Daniel and his companions were carried to Babylon, there to be brought up at the court and trained in all the learning of the Chaldeans. After this, in the fifth year of Jehoiakim, a great national fast was appointed ( Jeremiah 36:9 ), during which the king, to show his defiance, cut up the leaves of the book of Jeremiah's prophecies as they were read to him in his winter palace, and threw them into the fire. In the same spirit he rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar ( 2 Kings 24:1 ), who again a second time (B.C. 598) marched against Jerusalem, and put Jehoiachim to death, placing his son Jehoiachin on the throne in his stead. But Jehoiachin's counsellors displeasing Nebuchadnezzar, he again a third time turned his army against Jerusalem, and carried away to Babylon a second detachment of Jews as captives, to the number of 10,000 ( 2 Kings 24:1 3;  Jeremiah 24:1 ;  2 Chronicles 36:10 ), among whom were the king, with his mother and all his princes and officers, also Ezekiel, who with many of his companions were settled on the banks of the river Chebar (q.v.). He also carried away all the remaining treasures of the temple and the palace, and the golden vessels of the sanctuary.", "Mattaniah, the uncle of Jehoiachin, was now made king over what remained of the kingdom of Judah, under the name of Zedekiah ( 2 Kings 24:1 7;  2 Chronicles 36:10 ). After a troubled reign of eleven years his kingdom came to an end ( 2 Chronicles 36:11 ). Nebuchadnezzar, with a powerful army, besieged Jerusalem, and Zedekiah became a prisoner in Babylon. His eyes were put out, and he was kept in close confinement till his death ( 2 Kings 25:7 ). The city was spoiled of all that was of value, and then given up to the flames. The temple and palaces were consumed, and the walls of the city were levelled with the ground (B.C. 586), and all that remained of the people, except a number of the poorest class who were left to till the ground and dress the vineyards, were carried away captives to Babylon. This was the third and last deportation of Jewish captives. The land was now utterly desolate, and was abondoned to anarchy.", "In the first year of his reign as king of Babylon (B.C. 536), Cyrus issued a decree liberating the Jewish captives, and permitting them to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the city and the temple ( 2 Chronicles 36:22, 23 ; Ezra 1; 2). The number of the people forming the first caravan, under Zerubbabel, amounted in all to 42,360 ( Ezra 2:64, 65 ), besides 7,337 men-servants and maid-servants. A considerable number, 12,000 probably, from the ten tribes who had been carried away into Assyria no doubt combined with this band of liberated captives.", "At a later period other bands of the Jews returned (1) under Ezra ( 7:7 ) (B.C. 458), and (2) Nehemiah ( 7:66 ) (B.C. 445). But the great mass of the people remained still in the land to which they had been carried, and became a portion of the Jews of the \"dispersion\" ( John 7:35 ;  1 Peter 1:1 ).

These commandments were first given in their written form to the people of Israel when they were encamped at Sinai, about fifty days after they came out of Egypt ( Exodus 19:10-25 ). They were written by the finger of God on two tables of stone. The first tables were broken by Moses when he brought them down from the mount ( 32:19 ), being thrown by him on the ground. At the command of God he took up into the mount two other tables, and God wrote on them \"the words that were on the first tables\" ( 34:1 ). These tables were afterwards placed in the ark of the covenant ( Deuteronomy 10:5 ;  1 Kings 8:9 ). Their subsequent history is unknown. They are as a whole called \"the covenant\" ( Deuteronomy 4:13 ), and \"the tables of the covenant\" ( 9:9, 11 ;  Hebrews 9:4 ), and \"the testimony.\"", "They are obviously \"ten\" in number, but their division is not fixed, hence different methods of numbering them have been adopted. The Jews make the \"Preface\" one of the commandments, and then combine the first and second. The Roman Catholics and Lutherans combine the first and second and divide the tenth into two. The Jews and Josephus divide them equally. The Lutherans and Roman Catholics refer three commandments to the first table and seven to the second. The Greek and Reformed Churches refer four to the first and six to the second table. The Samaritans add to the second that Gerizim is the mount of worship.

The first nine chapters of Book I. contain little more than a list of genealogies in the line of Israel down to the time of David.", "2.  The remainder of the first book contains a history of the reign of David.", "3.  The first nine chapters of Book II. contain the history of the reign of Solomon.", "4.  The remaining chapters of the second book contain the history of the separate kingdom of Judah to the time of the return from Babylonian Exile.", "The time of the composition of the Chronicles was, there is every ground to conclude, subsequent to the Babylonian Exile, probably between 450 and 435 B.C. The contents of this twofold book, both as to matter and form, correspond closely with this idea. The close of the book records the proclamation of Cyrus permitting the Jews to return to their own land, and this forms the opening passage of the Book of Ezra, which must be viewed as a continuation of the Chronicles. The peculiar form of the language, being Aramaean in its general character, harmonizes also with that of the books which were written after the Exile. The author was certainly contemporary with Zerubbabel, details of whose family history are given ( 1 Chronicles 3:19 ).", "The time of the composition being determined, the question of the authorship may be more easily decided. According to Jewish tradition, which was universally received down to the middle of the seventeenth century, Ezra was regarded as the author of the Chronicles. There are many points of resemblance and of contact between the Chronicles and the Book of Ezra which seem to confirm this opinion. The conclusion of the one and the beginning of the other are almost identical in expression. In their spirit and characteristics they are the same, showing thus also an identity of authorship.", "In their general scope and design these books are not so much historical as didactic. The principal aim of the writer appears to be to present moral and religious truth. He does not give prominence to political occurences, as is done in Samuel and Kings, but to ecclesiastical institutions. \"The genealogies, so uninteresting to most modern readers, were really an important part of the public records of the Hebrew state. They were the basis on which not only the land was distributed and held, but the public services of the temple were arranged and conducted, the Levites and their descendants alone, as is well known, being entitled and first fruits set apart for that purpose.\" The \"Chronicles\" are an epitome of the sacred history from the days of Adam down to the return from Babylonian Exile, a period of about 3,500 years. The writer gathers up \"the threads of the old national life broken by the Captivity.\"", "The sources whence the chronicler compiled his work were public records, registers, and genealogical tables belonging to the Jews. These are referred to in the course of the book ( 1 Chronicles 27:24 ;  29:29 ;  2 Chronicles 9:29 ;  12:15 ;  13:22 ;  20:34 ;  24:27 ;  26:22 ;  32:32 ;  33:18, 19 ;  27:7 ;  35:25 ). There are in Chronicles, and the books of Samuel and Kings, forty parallels, often verbal, proving that the writer both knew and used these records ( 1 Chronicles 17:18 ; comp.  2 Samuel 7:18-20 ;  1 Chronicles 19 ; comp.  2 Samuel 10 , etc.).", "As compared with Samuel and Kings, the Book of Chronicles omits many particulars there recorded ( 2 Samuel 6:20-23 ;  9:11 ; 14-19, etc.), and includes many things peculiar to itself ( 1 Chronicles 12:22 ; 23-26; 27; 28; 29, etc.). Twenty whole chapters, and twenty-four parts of chapters, are occupied with matter not found elsewhere. It also records many things in fuller detail, as (e.g.) the list of David's heroes ( 1 Chronicles 12:1-37 ), the removal of the ark from Kirjath-jearim to Mount Zion ( 1 Chronicles 13 ;  15:2-24 ;  16:4-43 ; comp.  2 Samuel 6 ), Uzziah's leprosy and its cause ( 2 Chronicles 26:16-21 ; comp.  2 Kings 15:5 ), etc.", "It has also been observed that another peculiarity of the book is that it substitutes modern and more common expressions for those that had then become unusual or obsolete. This is seen particularly in the substitution of modern names of places, such as were in use in the writer's day, for the old names; thus Gezer ( 1 Chronicles 20:4 ) is used instead of Gob ( 2 Samuel 21:18 ), etc.", "The Books of Chronicles are ranked among the khethubim or hagiographa. They are alluded to, though not directly quoted, in the New Testament ( Hebrews 5:4 ;  Matthew 12:42 ;  23:35 ;  Luke 1:5 ;  11:31, 51 )."], "Word": "Chronicles, Books of", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "4": {"Definitions": ["the name originally given to the record made by the appointed historiographers in the kingdoms of Isr'l and Judah. In the LXX. these books are called  Paralipomena  (i.e. things omitted), which is understood as meaning that they are supplementary to the books of Kings. The constant tradition of the Jews is that these books were for the most part compiled by Ezra. One of the greatest difficulties connected with the captivity and return must have been the maintenance of that genealogical distribution of the land which yet was a vital point of the Jewish economy. To supply this want and that each tribe might secure the inheritance of its fathers on its return was one object of the author of these books. Another difficulty intimately connected with the former was the maintenance of the temple services at Jerusalem. Zerubbabel, and after him Ezra and Nehemiah, labored most earnestly to restore the worship of God among the people, and to reinfuse something of national life and spirit into their hearts. Nothing could more effectually aid these designs than setting before the people a compendious history of the kingdom of David, its prosperity under God; the sins that led to its overthrow; the captivity and return. These considerations explain the plan and scope of that historical work which consists of the two books of Chronicles. The first book contains the sacred history by genealogies from the Creation to David, including an account of David's reign. In the second book he continues the story, giving the history of the kings of Judah, without those of Isr'l, down to the return from the captivity. As regards the  materials  used by Ezra, they are not difficult to discover. The genealogies are obviously transcribed from some register in which were preserved the genealogies of the tribes and families drawn up at different times; while the history is mainly drawn from the same document as those used in the books of King.

The Canaanites in the valleys of Palestine had chariots of iron ( Joshua 17:18 ;  Judges 1:19 ). Jabin, the king of Canaan, had 900 chariots ( Judges 4:3 ); and in Saul's time the Philistines had 30,000. In his wars with the king of Zobah and with the Syrians, David took many chariots among the spoils ( 2 Samuel 8:4 ;  10:18 ). Solomon maintained as part of his army 1,400 chariots ( 1 Kings 10:26 ), which were chiefly imported from Egypt ( 29 ). From this time forward they formed part of the armies of Israel ( 1 Kings 22:34 ;  2 Kings 9:16, 21 ;  13:7, 14 ;  18:24 ;  23:30 ).", "In the New Testament we have only one historical reference to the use of chariots, in the case of the Ethiopian eunuch ( Acts. 8:28, 29, 38 ).", "This word is sometimes used figuratively for hosts ( Psalms 68:17 ;  2 Kings 6:17 ).

The Jewish chariots were patterned after the Egyptian, and consisted of a single pair of wheels on an axle, upon which was a car with high front and sides, but open at the back. The earliest mention of chariots in Scripture is in Egypt, where Joseph, as a mark of distinction, was placed in Pharaoh's second chariot. ( Genesis 41:43 ) Later on we find mention of Egyptian chariots for a warlike purpose. ( Exodus 14:7 ) In this point of view chariots among some nations of antiquity, as elephants among others, may be regarded as filling the place of heavy artillery in modern times, so that the military power of a nation might be estimated by the number of its chariots. Thus Pharaoh in pursuing Isr'l took with him 600 chariots. The Philistines in Saul's time had 30,000. ( 1 Samuel 13:5 ) David took from Hadadezer, king of Zobah, 1000 chariots, ( 2 Samuel 8:4 ) and from the Syrians a little later 700, ( 2 Samuel 10:18 ) who in order to recover their ground, collected 32,000 chariots. ( 1 Chronicles 19:7 ) Up to this time the Isr'lites possessed few or no chariots. They were first introduced by David, ( 2 Samuel 8:4 ) who raised and maintained a force of 1400 chariots, ( 1 Kings 10:25 ) by taxation on certain cities agreeably to eastern custom in such matters. ( 1 Kings 9:19 ;  10:25 ) From this time chariots were regarded as among the most important arms of war. ( 1 Kings 22:34 ;  2 Kings 9:16,21 ;  13:7,14 ;  18:24 ;  23:30 ;  Isaiah 31:1 ) Most commonly two persons, and sometimes three, rode in the chariot, of whom the third was employed to carry the state umbrella. ( 1 Kings 22:34 ;  2 Kings 9:20,24 ;  Acts 8:38 ) The prophets allude frequently to chariots as typical of power.

The hangings of the tabernacle court ( Exodus 27:9 ;  38:9 ), the coats, mitres, bonnets, and breeches of the priests ( Exodus 39:27, 28 ), and the dress of the high priest on the day of Atonement ( Leviticus 16:4, 32 ), were white.", "Black, applied to the hair ( Leviticus 13:31 ;  Song of Solomon 5:11 ), the complexion ( Song of Solomon 1:5 ), and to horses ( Zechariah 6:2, 6 ). The word rendered \"brown\" in  Genesis 30:32  (R.V., \"black\") means properly \"scorched\", i.e., the colour produced by the influence of the sun's rays. \"Black\" in  Job 30:30  means dirty, blackened by sorrow and disease. The word is applied to a mourner's robes ( Jeremiah 8:21 ;  14:2 ), to a clouded sky ( 1 Kings 18:45 ), to night ( Micah 3:6 ;  Jeremiah 4:28 ), and to a brook rendered turbid by melted snow ( Job 6:16 ). It is used as symbolical of evil in  Zechariah 6:2, 6  and  Revelation 6:5 . It was the emblem of mourning, affliction, calamity ( Jeremiah 14:2 ;  Lamentations 4:8 ;  5:10 ).", "Red, applied to blood ( 2 Kings 3:22 ), a heifer ( Numbers 19:2 ), pottage of lentils ( Genesis 25:30 ), a horse ( Zechariah 1:8 ), wine ( Proverbs 23:31 ), the complexion ( Genesis 25:25 ;  Song of Solomon 5:10 ). This colour is symbolical of bloodshed ( Zechariah 6:2 ;  Revelation 6:4 ;  12:3 ).", "Purple, a colour obtained from the secretion of a species of shell-fish (the Murex trunculus) which was found in the Mediterranean, and particularly on the coasts of Phoenicia and Asia Minor. The colouring matter in each separate shell-fish amounted to only a single drop, and hence the great value of this dye. Robes of this colour were worn by kings ( Judges 8:26 ) and high officers ( Esther 8:15 ). They were also worn by the wealthy and luxurious ( Jeremiah 10:9 ;  Ezekiel 27:7 ;  Luke 16:19 ;  Revelation 17:4 ). With this colour was associated the idea of royalty and majesty ( Judges 8:26 ;  Song of Solomon 3:10 ;  7:5 ;  Daniel 5:7, 16, 29 ).", "Blue. This colour was also procured from a species of shell-fish, the chelzon of the Hebrews, and the Helix ianthina of modern naturalists. The tint was emblematic of the sky, the deep dark hue of the Eastern sky. This colour was used in the same way as purple. The ribbon and fringe of the Hebrew dress were of this colour ( Numbers 15:38 ). The loops of the curtains ( Exodus 26:4 ), the lace of the high priest's breastplate, the robe of the ephod, and the lace on his mitre, were blue ( Exodus 28:28, 31, 37 ).", "Scarlet, or Crimson. In  Isaiah 1:18  a Hebrew word is used which denotes the worm or grub whence this dye was procured. In  Genesis 38:28, 30 , the word so rendered means \"to shine,\" and expresses the brilliancy of the colour. The small parasitic insects from which this dye was obtained somewhat resembled the cochineal which is found in Eastern countries. It is called by naturalists Coccus ilics. The dye was procured from the female grub alone. The only natural object to which this colour is applied in Scripture is the lips, which are likened to a scarlet thread ( Song of Solomon 4:3 ). Scarlet robes were worn by the rich and luxurious ( 2 Samuel 1:24 ;  Proverbs 31:21 ;  Jeremiah 4:30 .  Revelation 17:4 ). It was also the hue of the warrior's dress ( Nahum 2:3 ;  Isaiah 9:5 ). The Phoenicians excelled in the art of dyeing this colour ( 2 Chronicles 2:7 ).", "These four colours--white, purple, blue, and scarlet--were used in the textures of the tabernacle curtains ( Exodus 26:1, 31, 36 ), and also in the high priest's ephod, girdle, and breastplate ( Exodus 28:5, 6, 8, 15 ). Scarlet thread is mentioned in connection with the rites of cleansing the leper ( Leviticus 14:4, 6, 51 ) and of burning the red heifer ( Numbers 19:6 ).

Cyrus was a great military leader, bent on universal conquest. Babylon fell before his army (B.C. 538) on the night of Belshazzar's feast ( Daniel 5:30 ), and then the ancient dominion of Assyria was also added to his empire (cf., \"Go up, O Elam\",  Isaiah 21:2 ).", "Hitherto the great kings of the earth had only oppressed the Jews. Cyrus was to them as a \"shepherd\" ( Isaiah 44:28 ;  45:1 ). God employed him in doing service to his ancient people. He may posibly have gained, through contact with the Jews, some knowledge of their religion.", "The \"first year of Cyrus\" ( Ezra 1:1 ) is not the year of his elevation to power over the Medes, nor over the Persians, nor the year of the fall of Babylon, but the year succeeding the two years during which \"Darius the Mede\" was viceroy in Babylon after its fall. At this time only (B.C. 536) Cyrus became actual king over Palestine, which became a part of his Babylonian empire. The edict of Cyrus for the rebuilding of Jerusalem marked a great epoch in the history of the Jewish people ( 2 Chronicles 36:22, 23 ;  Ezra 1:1-4;   4:3 ;  5:13-17 ;  6:3-5 ).", "This decree was discovered \"at Achmetha [R.V. marg., \"Ecbatana\"], in the palace that is in the province of the Medes\" ( Ezra 6:2 ).

In B.C. 538 there was a revolt in Southern Babylonia, while the army of Cyrus entered the country from the north. In June the Babylonian army was completely defeated at Opis, and immediately afterwards Sippara opened its gates to the conqueror. Gobryas (Ugbaru), the governor of Kurdistan, was then sent to Babylon, which surrendered \"without fighting,\" and the daily services in the temples continued without a break. In October, Cyrus himself arrived, and proclaimed a general amnesty, which was communicated by Gobryas to \"all the province of Babylon,\" of which he had been made governor. Meanwhile, Nabonidus, who had concealed himself, was captured, but treated honourably; and when his wife died, Cambyses, the son of Cyrus, conducted the funeral. Cyrus now assumed the title of \"king of Babylon,\" claimed to be the descendant of the ancient kings, and made rich offerings to the temples. At the same time he allowed the foreign populations who had been deported to Babylonia to return to their old homes, carrying with them the images of their gods.

A son, probably the eldest, of Ham, and the father of Nimrod ( Genesis 10:8 ;  1 Chronicles 1:10 ). From him the land of Cush seems to have derived its name. The question of the precise locality of the land of Cush has given rise to not a little controversy. The second river of Paradise surrounded the whole land of Cush ( Genesis 2:13 , R.V.). The term Cush is in the Old Testament generally applied to the countries south of the Israelites. It was the southern limit of Egypt ( Ezekiel 29:10 , A.V. \"Ethiopia,\" Heb. Cush), with which it is generally associated ( Psalms 68:31 ;  Isaiah 18:1 ;  Jeremiah 46:9 , etc.). It stands also associated with Elam ( Isaiah 11:11 ), with Persia ( Ezekiel 38:5 ), and with the Sabeans ( Isaiah 45:14 ). From these facts it has been inferred that Cush included Arabia and the country on the west coast of the Red Sea. Rawlinson takes it to be the country still known as Khuzi-stan, on the east side of the Lower Tigris. But there are intimations which warrant the conclusion that there was also a Cush in Africa, the Ethiopia (so called by the Greeks) of Africa. Ezekiel speaks ( 29:10 ; comp.  30:4-6 ) of it as lying south of Egypt. It was the country now known to us as Nubia and Abyssinia ( Isaiah 18:1 ;  Zephaniah 3:10 , Heb. Cush). In ancient Egyptian inscriptions Ethiopia is termed Kesh. The Cushites appear to have spread along extensive tracts, stretching from the Upper Nile to the Euphrates and Tigris. At an early period there was a stream of migration of Cushites \"from Ethiopia, properly so called, through Arabia, Babylonia, and Persia, to Western India.\" The Hamite races, soon after their arrival in Africa, began to spread north, east, and west. Three branches of the Cushite or Ethiopian stock, moving from Western Asia, settled in the regions contiguous to the Persian Gulf. One branch, called the Cossaeans, settled in the mountainous district on the east of the Tigris, known afterwards as Susiana; another occupied the lower regions of the Euphrates and the Tigris; while a third colonized the southern shores and islands of the gulf, whence they afterwards emigrated to the Mediterranean and settled on the coast of Palestine as the Phoenicians. Nimrod was a great Cushite chief. He conquered the Accadians, a Tauranian race, already settled in Mesopotamia, and founded his kingdom, the Cushites mingling with the Accads, and so forming the Chaldean nation.", "2.

The wants of a teeming population were supplied by a rich soil, not less bountiful than that on the banks of the Egyptian Nile.

The ancestor of the Hebrew people, Abram, was, we are told, born at \"Ur of the Chaldees.\" \"Chaldees\" is a mistranslation of the Hebrew Kasdim, Kasdim being the Old Testament name of the Babylonians, while the Chaldees were a tribe who lived on the shores of the Persian Gulf, and did not become a part of the Babylonian population till the time of Hezekiah. Ur was one of the oldest and most famous of the Babylonian cities. Its site is now called Mugheir, or Mugayyar, on the western bank of the Euphrates, in Southern Babylonia. About a century before the birth of Abram it was ruled by a powerful dynasty of kings. Their conquests extended to Elam on the one side, and to the Lebanon on the other. They were followed by a dynasty of princes whose capital was Babylon, and who seem to have been of South Arabian origin. The founder of the dynasty was Sumu-abi (\"Shem is my father\"). But soon afterwards Babylonia fell under Elamite dominion. The kings of Babylon were compelled to acknowledge the supremacy of Elam, and a rival kingdom to that of Babylon, and governed by Elamites, sprang up at Larsa, not far from Ur, but on the opposite bank of the river. In the time of Abram the king of Larsa was Eri-Aku, the son of an Elamite prince, and Eri-Aku, as has long been recognized, is the Biblical \"Arioch king of Ellasar\" ( Genesis 14:1 ). The contemporaneous king of Babylon in the north, in the country termed Shinar in Scripture, was Khammu-rabi.

A concubine would generally be either (1) a Hebrew girl bought of her father; (2) a Gentile captive taken in war; (3) a foreign slave bought; or (4) a Canaanitish woman, bond or free. The rights of the first two were protected by the law, ( Exodus 21:7 ;  21:10-14 ) but the third was unrecognized and the fourth prohibited. Free Hebrew women also might become concubines.

This rite, practised before, as some think, by divers races, was appointed by God to be the special badge of his chosen people, an abiding sign of their consecration to him. It was established as a national ordinance ( Genesis 17:10, 11 ). In compliance with the divine command, Abraham, though ninety-nine years of age, was circumcised on the same day with Ishmael, who was thirteen years old ( 17:24-27 ). Slaves, whether home-born or purchased, were circumcised ( 17:12, 13 ); and all foreigners must have their males circumcised before they could enjoy the privileges of Jewish citizenship ( Exodus 12:48 ). During the journey through the wilderness, the practice of circumcision fell into disuse, but was resumed by the command of Joshua before they entered the Promised Land ( Joshua 5:2-9) . It was observed always afterwards among the tribes of israel, although it is not expressly mentioned from the time of the settlement in Canaan till the time of Christ, about 1,450 years. The Jews prided themselves in the possession of this covenant distinction ( Judges 14:3 ;  15:18 ;  1 Samuel 14:6 ;  17:2 6;  2 Samuel 1:20 ;  Ezekiel 31:18 ).", "As a rite of the church it ceased when the New Testament times began ( Galatians 6:15 ;  Colossians 3:11 ). Some Jewish Christians sought to impose it, however, on the Gentile converts; but this the apostles resolutely resisted ( Acts 15:1 ;  Galatians 6:12 ). Our Lord was circumcised, for it \"became him to fulfil all righteousness,\" as of the seed of Abraham, according to the flesh; and Paul \"took and circumcised\" Timothy ( Acts 16:3 ), to avoid giving offence to the Jews. It would render Timothy's labours more acceptable to the Jews. But Paul would by no means consent to the demand that Titus should be circumcised ( Galatians 2:3-5) . The great point for which he contended was the free admission of uncircumcised Gentiles into the church. He contended successfully in behalf of Titus, even in Jerusalem.", "In the Old Testament a spiritual idea is attached to circumcision. It was the symbol of purity ( Isaiah 52:1 ). We read of uncircumcised lips ( Exodus 6:12, 30 ), ears ( Jeremiah 6:10 ), hearts ( Leviticus 26:41 ). The fruit of a tree that is unclean is spoken of as uncircumcised ( Leviticus 19:23 ).", "It was a sign and seal of the covenant of grace as well as of the national covenant between God and the Hebrews.", "1.  It sealed the promises made to Abraham, which related to the commonwealth of Israel, national promises.", "2.  But the promises made to Abraham included the promise of redemption ( Galatians 3:14 ), a promise which has come upon us. The covenant with Abraham was a dispensation or a specific form of the covenant of grace, and circumcision was a sign and seal of that covenant. It had a spiritual meaning. It signified purification of the heart, inward circumcision effected by the Spirit ( Deuteronomy 10:16 ;  30:6 ;  Ezekiel 44:7 ;  Acts 7:51 ;  Romans 2:28 ;  Colossians 2:11 ). Circumcision as a symbol shadowing forth sanctification by the Holy Spirit has now given way to the symbol of baptism (q.v.).

The biblical notice of the rite describes it as distinctively Jewish; so that in the New Testament \"the circumcision\" and \"the uncircumcision\" are frequently used as synonyms for the Jews and the Gentiles. The rite has been found to prevail extensively in both ancient and modern times. Though Mohammed did not enjoin circumcision in the Koran, he was circumcised himself, according to the custom of his country; and circumcision is now as common among the Mohammedans as among the Jews. The process of restoring a circumcised person to his natural condition by a surgical operation was sometimes undergone. Some of the Jews in the time of Antiochus Epiphanes, wishing to assimilate themselves to the heathen around them, \"made themselves uncircumcised.\" Against having recourse to this practice, from an excessive anti-Judaistic tendency, St. Paul cautions the Corinthians.

They were written by the finger of God on two tables of stone. The first tables were broken by Moses when he brought them down from the mount ( 32:19 ), being thrown by him on the ground. At the command of God he took up into the mount two other tables, and God wrote on them \"the words that were on the first tables\" ( 34:1 ). These tables were afterwards placed in the ark of the covenant ( Deuteronomy 10:5 ;  1 Kings 8:9 ). Their subsequent history is unknown. They are as a whole called \"the covenant\" ( Deuteronomy 4:13 ), and \"the tables of the covenant\" ( 9:9, 11 ;  Hebrews 9:4 ), and \"the testimony.\"", "They are obviously \"ten\" in number, but their division is not fixed, hence different methods of numbering them have been adopted. The Jews make the \"Preface\" one of the commandments, and then combine the first and second. The Roman Catholics and Lutherans combine the first and second and divide the tenth into two. The Jews and Josephus divide them equally. The Lutherans and Roman Catholics refer three commandments to the first table and seven to the second. The Greek and Reformed Churches refer four to the first and six to the second table. The Samaritans add to the second that Gerizim is the mount of worship.
