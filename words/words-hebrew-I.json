Of the forms assumed by the idolatrous images we have not many traces in the Bible. Dagon, the fish-god of the Philistines, was a human figure terminating in a fish; and that the Syrian deities were represented in later times in a symbolical human shape we know for certainty.

The first allusion to idolatry is in the account of Rachel stealing her father's teraphim ( Genesis 31:19 ), which were the relics of the worship of other gods by Laban's progenitors \"on the other side of the river in old time\" ( Joshua 24:2 ). During their long residence in Egypt the Hebrews fell into idolatry, and it was long before they were delivered from it ( Joshua 24:14 ;  Ezekiel 20:7 ). Many a token of God's displeasure fell upon them because of this sin.", "The idolatry learned in Egypt was probably rooted out from among the people during the forty years' wanderings; but when the Jews entered Palestine, they came into contact with the monuments and associations of the idolatry of the old Canaanitish races, and showed a constant tendency to depart from the living God and follow the idolatrous practices of those heathen nations. It was their great national sin, which was only effectually rebuked by the Babylonian exile. That exile finally purified the Jews of all idolatrous tendencies.", "The first and second commandments are directed against idolatry of every form. Individuals and communities were equally amenable to the rigorous code. The individual offender was devoted to destruction ( Exodus 22:20 ). His nearest relatives were not only bound to denounce him and deliver him up to punishment ( Deuteronomy 13:20-10 ), but their hands were to strike the first blow when, on the evidence of two witnesses at least, he was stoned ( Deuteronomy 17:2-7) . To attempt to seduce others to false worship was a crime of equal enormity ( 13:6-10 ). An idolatrous nation shared the same fate. No facts are more strongly declared in the Old Testament than that the extermination of the Canaanites was the punishment of their idolatry ( Exodus 34:15, 16 ;  Deuteronomy 7 ;  12:29-31 ;  20:17 ), and that the calamities of the Israelites were due to the same cause ( Jeremiah 2:17 ). \"A city guilty of idolatry was looked upon as a cancer in the state; it was considered to be in rebellion, and treated according to the laws of war. Its inhabitants and all their cattle were put to death.\" Jehovah was the theocratic King of Israel, the civil Head of the commonwealth, and therefore to an Israelite idolatry was a state offence ( 1 Samuel 15:23 ), high treason. On taking possession of the land, the Jews were commanded to destroy all traces of every kind of the existing idolatry of the Canaanites ( Exodus 23:24, 32 ;  34:13 ;  Deuteronomy 7:5, 25 ;  12:1-3 ).", "In the New Testament the term idolatry is used to designate covetousness ( Matthew 6:24 ;

I.  History of idolatry among the Jews.", "The first undoubted allusion to idolatry or idolatrous customs in the Bible is in the account of Rachel's stealing her father's teraphim. ( Genesis 31:19 ) During their long residence in Egypt the Isr'lites defiled themselves with the idols of the land, and it was long before the taint was removed. ( Joshua 24:14 ;  Ezekiel 20:7 ) In the wilderness they clamored for some visible shape in which they might worship the God who had brought them out of Egypt. ( Exodus 32:1 ) ... until Aaron made the calf, the embodiment of Apis and emblem of the productive power of nature. During the lives of Joshua and the elders who outlived him they kept true to their allegiance; but the generation following who knew not Jehovah nor the works he had done for Isr'l, swerved from the plain path of their fathers and were caught in the toils of the foreigner. ( Judges 2:1 ) ... From this time forth their history becomes little more than a chronicle of the inevitable sequence of offence and punishment. ( Judges 2:12,14 ) By turns each conquering nation strove to establish the worship of its national God. In later times the practice of secret idolatry was carried to greater lengths. Images were set up on the corn-floors, in the wine-vats, and behind the doors of private houses, ( Isaiah 57:8 ;  Hosea 9:1,2 ) and to check this tendency the statute in ( 27:15 ) was originally promulgated. Under Samuel's administration idolatry was publicly renounced, ( 1 Samuel 7:3-6 ) but in the reign of Solomon all this was forgotten, even Solomon's own heart being turned after other gods. ( 1 Kings 11:14 ) Rehoboam perpetuated the worst features of Solomon's idolatry. ( 1 Kings 14:22-24 ) erected golden calves at Beth-el and at Dan, and by this crafty state' policy severed forever the kingdoms of Judah and Isr'l. ( 1 Kings 12:26-33 ) The successors of Jeroboam followed in his steps, till Ahab. The conquest of the ten tribes by Shalmaneser was for them the last scene Of the drama of abominations which had been enacted uninterruptedly for upwards of 250 years. Under Hezekiah a great reform was inaugurated, that was not confined to Judah and Benjamin, but spread throughout Ephraim and Manasseh. ( 2 Chronicles 31:1 ) and to all external appearances idolatry was extirpated. But the reform extended little below the surface. ( Isaiah 29:13 ) With the death of Josiah ended the last effort to revive among the people a purer ritual. If not a purer faith. The lamp of David, which had long shed but a struggling ray, flickered for a while and then went out in the darkness of Babylonian Captivity. Though the conquests of Alexander caused Greek influence to be felt, yet after the captivity better condition of things prevailed, and the Jews never again fell into idolatry. The erection of synagogues had been assigned as a reason for the comparative purity of the Jewish worship after the captivity, while another cause has been discovered in the hatred for images acquired by the Jews in their intercourse with the Persians. II.  Objects of idolatry  .", "The sun and moon were early selected as outward symbols of all-pervading power, and the worship of the heavenly bodies was not only the most ancient but the most prevalent system of idolatry. Taking its rise in the plains of Chaldea, it spread through Egypt, Greece, Scythia, and even Mexico and Ceylon. Comp. ( 4:19 ;  17:3 ;  Job 31:20-28 ) In the later times of the monarchy, the planets or the zodiacal signs received, next to the sun and moon, their share of popular adoration. ( 2 Kings 23:5 ) Beast-worship, as exemplified in the calves of Jeroboam, has already been alluded to of pure hero-worship among the Semitic races we find no trace. The singular reverence with which trees have been honored is not without example in the history of the Hebrew. The terebinth (oak) at Mamre, beneath which Abraham built an altar, ( Genesis 12:7 ;  13:18 ) and the memorial grove planted by him at Beersheba, ( Genesis 21:33 ) were intimately connected with patriarchal worship. Mountains and high places were chosen spots for offering sacrifice and incense to idols, ( 1 Kings 11:7 ;  14:23 ) and the retirement of gardens and the thick shade of woods offered great attractions to their worshippers. ( 2 Kings 16:4 ;  Isaiah 1:29 ;  Hosea 4:13 ) The host of heaven was worshipped on the house-top. ( 2 Kings 23:12 ;  Jeremiah 19:3 ;  32:29 ;  Zephaniah 1:5 ) (The modern objects of idolatry are less gross than the ancient, but are none the less idols. Whatever of wealth or honor or pleasure is loved and sought before God and righteousness becomes an object of idolatry.", "ED.) III.  Punishment of idolatry  .", "Idolatry to an Isr'lite was a state offence, ( 1 Samuel 15:23 ) a political crime of the greatest character, high treason against the majesty of his king. The first and second commandments are directed against idolatry of every form. Individuals and communities were equally amenable to the rigorous code. The individual offender was devoted to destruction, ( Exodus 22:20 ) his nearest relatives were not only bound to denounce him and deliver him up to punishment, ( 13:2-10 ) but their hands were to strike the first blow, when, on the evidence of two witnesses at least, he was stoned. ( 17:2-5 ) To attempt to seduce others to false worship was a crime of equal enormity. ( 13:6-10 ) IV.  Attractions of idolatry  .", "Many have wondered why the Isr'lites were so easily led away from the true God, into the worship of idols. (1) Visible, outward signs, with shows, pageants, parades, have an attraction to the natural heart, which often fail to perceive the unseen spiritual realities. (2) But the greatest attraction seems to have been in licentious revelries and obscene orgies with which the worship of the Oriental idols was observed. This worship, appealing to every sensual passion, joined with the attractions of wealth and fashion and luxury, naturally was a great temptation to a simple, restrained, agricultural people, whose worship and law demands the greatest purity of heart and of life.", "ED.)"], "Word": "Idolatry", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "13": {"Definitions": ["IDOL'ATRY ,  noun   [Latin  idololatria.

Dagon, the fish-god of the Philistines, was a human figure terminating in a fish; and that the Syrian deities were represented in later times in a symbolical human shape we know for certainty.

During their long residence in Egypt the Hebrews fell into idolatry, and it was long before they were delivered from it ( Joshua 24:14 ;  Ezekiel 20:7 ).

It was their great national sin, which was only effectually rebuked by the Babylonian exile. That exile finally purified the Jews of all idolatrous tendencies.", "The first and second commandments are directed against idolatry of every form. Individuals and communities were equally amenable to the rigorous code. The individual offender was devoted to destruction ( Exodus 22:20 ). His nearest relatives were not only bound to denounce him and deliver him up to punishment ( Deuteronomy 13:20-10 ), but their hands were to strike the first blow when, on the evidence of two witnesses at least, he was stoned ( Deuteronomy 17:2-7) . To attempt to seduce others to false worship was a crime of equal enormity ( 13:6-10 ). An idolatrous nation shared the same fate. No facts are more strongly declared in the Old Testament than that the extermination of the Canaanites was the punishment of their idolatry ( Exodus 34:15, 16 ;  Deuteronomy 7 ;  12:29-31 ;  20:17 ), and that the calamities of the Israelites were due to the same cause ( Jeremiah 2:17 ). \"A city guilty of idolatry was looked upon as a cancer in the state; it was considered to be in rebellion, and treated according to the laws of war. Its inhabitants and all their cattle were put to death.\" Jehovah was the theocratic King of Israel, the civil Head of the commonwealth, and therefore to an Israelite idolatry was a state offence ( 1 Samuel 15:23 ), high treason.

During the lives of Joshua and the elders who outlived him they kept true to their allegiance; but the generation following who knew not Jehovah nor the works he had done for Isr'l, swerved from the plain path of their fathers and were caught in the toils of the foreigner. ( Judges 2:1 ) ... From this time forth their history becomes little more than a chronicle of the inevitable sequence of offence and punishment. ( Judges 2:12,14 ) By turns each conquering nation strove to establish the worship of its national God. In later times the practice of secret idolatry was carried to greater lengths. Images were set up on the corn-floors, in the wine-vats, and behind the doors of private houses, ( Isaiah 57:8 ;  Hosea 9:1,2 ) and to check this tendency the statute in ( 27:15 ) was originally promulgated. Under Samuel's administration idolatry was publicly renounced, ( 1 Samuel 7:3-6 ) but in the reign of Solomon all this was forgotten, even Solomon's own heart being turned after other gods. ( 1 Kings 11:14 ) Rehoboam perpetuated the worst features of Solomon's idolatry. ( 1 Kings 14:22-24 ) erected golden calves at Beth-el and at Dan, and by this crafty state' policy severed forever the kingdoms of Judah and Isr'l. ( 1 Kings 12:26-33 ) The successors of Jeroboam followed in his steps, till Ahab. The conquest of the ten tribes by Shalmaneser was for them the last scene Of the drama of abominations which had been enacted uninterruptedly for upwards of 250 years. Under Hezekiah a great reform was inaugurated, that was not confined to Judah and Benjamin, but spread throughout Ephraim and Manasseh. ( 2 Chronicles 31:1 ) and to all external appearances idolatry was extirpated. But the reform extended little below the surface. ( Isaiah 29:13 ) With the death of Josiah ended the last effort to revive among the people a purer ritual. If not a purer faith. The lamp of David, which had long shed but a struggling ray, flickered for a while and then went out in the darkness of Babylonian Captivity. Though the conquests of Alexander caused Greek influence to be felt, yet after the captivity better condition of things prevailed, and the Jews never again fell into idolatry. The erection of synagogues had been assigned as a reason for the comparative purity of the Jewish worship after the captivity, while another cause has been discovered in the hatred for images acquired by the Jews in their intercourse with the Persians. II.  Objects of idolatry  .", "The sun and moon were early selected as outward symbols of all-pervading power, and the worship of the heavenly bodies was not only the most ancient but the most prevalent system of idolatry. Taking its rise in the plains of Chaldea, it spread through Egypt, Greece, Scythia, and even Mexico and Ceylon. Comp. ( 4:19 ;  17:3 ;  Job 31:20-28 ) In the later times of the monarchy, the planets or the zodiacal signs received, next to the sun and moon, their share of popular adoration. ( 2 Kings 23:5 ) Beast-worship, as exemplified in the calves of Jeroboam, has already been alluded to of pure hero-worship among the Semitic races we find no trace. The singular reverence with which trees have been honored is not without example in the history of the Hebrew. The terebinth (oak) at Mamre, beneath which Abraham built an altar, ( Genesis 12:7 ;  13:18 ) and the memorial grove planted by him at Beersheba, ( Genesis 21:33 ) were intimately connected with patriarchal worship. Mountains and high places were chosen spots for offering sacrifice and incense to idols, ( 1 Kings 11:7 ;  14:23 ) and the retirement of gardens and the thick shade of woods offered great attractions to their worshippers. ( 2 Kings 16:4 ;  Isaiah 1:29 ;  Hosea 4:13 ) The host of heaven was worshipped on the house-top. ( 2 Kings 23:12 ;  Jeremiah 19:3 ;  32:29 ;  Zephaniah 1:5 ) (The modern objects of idolatry are less gross than the ancient, but are none the less idols. Whatever of wealth or honor or pleasure is loved and sought before God and righteousness becomes an object of idolatry.", "ED.) III.  Punishment of idolatry  .", "Idolatry to an Isr'lite was a state offence, ( 1 Samuel 15:23 ) a political crime of the greatest character, high treason against the majesty of his king. The first and second commandments are directed against idolatry of every form. Individuals and communities were equally amenable to the rigorous code. The individual offender was devoted to destruction, ( Exodus 22:20 ) his nearest relatives were not only bound to denounce him and deliver him up to punishment, ( 13:2-10 ) but their hands were to strike the first blow, when, on the evidence of two witnesses at least, he was stoned. ( 17:2-5 ) To attempt to seduce others to false worship was a crime of equal enormity. ( 13:6-10 ) IV.  Attractions of idolatry  .", "Many have wondered why the Isr'lites were so easily led away from the true God, into the worship of idols. (1) Visible, outward signs, with shows, pageants, parades, have an attraction to the natural heart, which often fail to perceive the unseen spiritual realities. (2) But the greatest attraction seems to have been in licentious revelries and obscene orgies with which the worship of the Oriental idols was observed. This worship, appealing to every sensual passion, joined with the attractions of wealth and fashion and luxury, naturally was a great temptation to a simple, restrained, agricultural people, whose worship and law demands the greatest purity of heart and of life.", "ED.)"], "Word": "Idolatry", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "13": {"Definitions": ["IDOL'ATRY ,  noun   [Latin  idololatria.

We receive it through the Latin and Greek from the Shemitic jod, je, or ye, in Greek iwra, whence our English word jot. The vowel in French, and in most European languages, has the long fine sound which we express by e in me, or ee in seen, meek. This sound we retain in some foreign words which are naturalized in our language, as in machine, intrigue. But in most English words this long sound is shortened, as in holiness, pity, gift; in which words the sound of  i  coincides with that of y in hypocrite, cycle, and at the end of words, in unaccented syllables, as in holy, glory. It is this short sound of the French and Italian  i   which we hear in the pronunciation of been, which we pronounce bin. After l, this letter has sometimes the liquid sound of y, as in million, pronounced milyon. This sound corresponds with that of the Hebrews, as in Joseph, which in Syria is pronounced Yoseph, and with the sound of the German j, as in ja, jahr, that is ya, yahr.", "The sound of  i  long, as in fine, kind, arise, is diphthongal; it begins with a sound approaching that of broad a, but it is not exactly the same, as the organs are not opened to the same extent, and therefore the sound begins a little above that of aw. The sound, if continued, closes with one that nearly approaches to that of e long. This sound can be learned only by the ear. This letter enters into several digraphs, as in fail, field, seize, feign, vein, friend; and with o in oil, join, coin, it helps to form a proper diphthong.", "No English word ends with  i   but when the sound of the letter occurs at the end of a word, it is expressed by y.", "As a numeral  i  signifies one, and stands for as many units as it is repeated in times, as II, two, III, three, etc. When it stands before V or X, it subtracts itself, and the numerals denote one less than the V or the X. Thus IV expresses four, one less than V, five; IX stands for nine, one less than X, ten. But when it is placed after V or X, it denotes the addition of an unit, or as many units as the letter is repeated in times. Thus VI is five and one, or six, and XI is ten and one, or eleven; VIII stands for five and three, or eight, etc.", "I , formerly prefixed to some English words, as in ibuilt, is a contraction of the Saxon prefix ge; and more generally this was written y.", "I ,  pronoun   [Latin  ego.] The pronoun of the first person; the word which expresses one's self, or that by which a speaker or writer denotes himself. It is only the nominative case of the pronoun; in the other cases we use me.  i  am attached to study; study delights me.

He lived till the fourteenth year of Hezekiah, and in all likelihood outlived that monarch (who died B.C. 698), and may have been contemporary for some years with Manasseh. Thus Isaiah may have prophesied for the long period of at least sixty-four years.", "His first call to the prophetical office is not recorded. A second call came to him \"in the year that King Uzziah died\" ( Isaiah 6:1 ). He exercised his ministry in a spirit of uncompromising firmness and boldness in regard to all that bore on the interests of religion. He conceals nothing and keeps nothing back from fear of man. He was also noted for his spirituality and for his deep-toned reverence toward \"the holy One of Israel.\"", "In early youth Isaiah must have been moved by the invasion of Israel by the Assyrian monarch Pul (q.v.),  2 Kings 15:19 ; and again, twenty years later, when he had already entered on his office, by the invasion of Tiglath-pileser and his career of conquest. Ahaz, king of Judah, at this crisis refused to co-operate with the kings of Israel and Syria in opposition to the Assyrians, and was on that account attacked and defeated by Rezin of Damascus and Pekah of Samaria ( 2 Kings 16:5 ;  2 Chronicles 28:5, 6 ). Ahaz, thus humbled, sided with Assyria, and sought the aid of Tiglath-pileser against Israel and Syria. The consequence was that Rezin and Pekah were conquered and many of the people carried captive to Assyria ( 2 Kings 15:29 ;  16:9 ;  1 Chronicles 5:26 ). Soon after this Shalmaneser determined wholly to subdue the kingdom of Israel. Samaria was taken and destroyed (B.C. 722). So long as Ahaz reigned, the kingdom of Judah was unmolested by the Assyrian power; but on his accession to the throne, Hezekiah (B.C. 726), who \"rebelled against the king of Assyria\" ( 2 Kings 18:7 ), in which he was encouraged by Isaiah, who exhorted the people to place all their dependence on Jehovah ( Isaiah 10:24 ;  37:6 ), entered into an alliance with the king of Egypt ( Isaiah 30:2-4) . This led the king of Assyria to threaten the king of Judah, and at length to invade the land. Sennacherib (B.C. 701) led a powerful army into Palestine. Hezekiah was reduced to despair, and submitted to the Assyrians ( 2 Kings 18:14-16 ). But after a brief interval war broke out again, and again Sennacherib (q.v.) led an army into Palestine, one detachment of which threatened Jerusalem ( Isaiah 36:2-22 ;  37:8 ). Isaiah on that occasion encouraged Hezekiah to resist the Assyrians ( 37:1-7 ), whereupon Sennacherib sent a threatening letter to Hezekiah, which he \"spread before the Lord\" ( 37:14 ). The judgement of God now fell on the Assyrian host. \"Like Xerxes in Greece, Sennacherib never recovered from the shock of the disaster in Judah. He made no more expeditions against either Southern Palestine or Egypt.\" The remaining years of Hezekiah's reign were peaceful ( 2 Chronicles 32:23, 27 -29). Isaiah probably lived to its close, and possibly into the reign of Manasseh, but the time and manner of his death are unknown.

The diversity of subjects treated of and the peculiarities of the prophet's position at the time the prophecies were uttered will sufficiently account for this.", "The arguments in favour of the unity of the book are quite conclusive. When the LXX. version was made (about B.C. 250) the entire contents of the book were ascribed to Isaiah, the son of Amoz. It is not called in question, moreover, that in the time of our Lord the book existed in the form in which we now have it. Many prophecies in the disputed portions are quoted in the New Testament as the words of Isaiah ( Matthew 3:3 ;  Luke 3:4-6;   4:16-41 ;  John 12:38 ;  Acts 8:28 ;  Romans 10:16-21 ). Universal and persistent tradition has ascribed the whole book to one author.", "Besides this, the internal evidence, the similarity in the language and style, in the thoughts and images and rhetorical ornaments, all points to the same conclusion; and its local colouring and allusions show that it is obviously of Palestinian origin. The theory therefore of a double authorship of the book, much less of a manifold authorship, cannot be maintained. The book, with all the diversity of its contents, is one, and is, we believe, the production of the great prophet whose name it bears."], "Word": "Isaiah, the Book of", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}}}

At the age of thirteen he was circumcised ( 17:25 ). He grew up a true child of the desert, wild and wayward.

Soon after the death of Solomon, Ahijah's prophecy ( 1 Kings 11:31-35 ) was fulfilled, and the kingdom was rent in twain. Rehoboam, the son and successor of Solomon, was scarcely seated on his throne when the old jealousies between Judah and the other tribes broke out anew, and Jeroboam was sent for from Egypt by the malcontents ( 12:2, 3 ). Rehoboam insolently refused to lighten the burdensome taxation and services which his father had imposed on his subjects ( 12:4 ), and the rebellion became complete. Ephraim and all Israel raised the old cry, \"Every man to his tents, O Israel\" ( 2 Samuel 20:1 ). Rehoboam fled to Jerusalem ( 1 Kings 12:1-18 ; 2 Chronicles 10), and Jeroboam was proclaimed king over all Israel at Shechem, Judah and Benjamin remaining faithful to Solomon's son. War, with varying success, was carried on between the two kingdoms for about sixty years, till Jehoshaphat entered into an alliance with the house of Ahab.", "Extent of the kingdom. In the time of Solomon the area of Palestine, excluding the Phoenician territories on the shore of the Mediterranean, did not much exceed 13,000 square miles. The kingdom of Israel comprehended about 9,375 square miles. Shechem was the first capital of this kingdom ( 1 Kings 12:25 ), afterwards Tirza ( 14:17 ). Samaria was subsequently chosen as the capital ( 16:24 ), and continued to be so till the destruction of the kingdom by the Assyrians ( 2 Kings 17:5 ). During the siege of Samaria (which lasted for three years) by the Assyrians, Shalmaneser died and was succeeded by Sargon, who himself thus records the capture of that city- \"Samaria I looked at, I captured; 27,280 men who dwelt in it I carried away\" ( 2 Kings 17:6 ) into Assyria. Thus after a duration of two hundred and fifty-three years the kingdom of the ten tribes came to an end. They were scattered throughout the East. (See  CAPTIVITY .)", "\"Judah held its ground against Assyria for yet one hundred and twenty-three years, and became the rallying-point of the dispersed of every tribe, and eventually gave its name to the whole race. Those of the people who in the last struggle escaped into the territories of Judah or other neighbouring countries naturally looked to Judah as the head and home of their race. And when Judah itself was carried off to Babylon, many of the exiled Israelites joined them from Assyria, and swelled that immense population which made Babylonia a second Palestine.\"", "After the deportation of the ten tribes, the deserted land was colonized by various eastern tribes, whom the king of Assyria sent thither ( Ezra 4:2, 10 ;  2 Kings 17:24-29 ). (See  KING .)", "In contrast with the kingdom of Judah is that of Israel.", "1.  \"There was no fixed capital and no religious centre.", "2.  The army was often insubordinate.", "3.  The succession was constantly interrupted, so that out of nineteen kings there were no less than nine dynasties, each ushered in by a revolution.", "4.  The authorized priests left the kingdom in a body, and the priesthood established by Jeroboam had no divine sanction and no promise; it was corrupt at its very source.\" (Maclean's O. T. Hist.)"], "Word": "Israel, Kingdom of", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "6": {"Definitions": ["I.  the kingdom.", "The prophet Ahijah of Shiloh, who was commissioned in the latter days of Solomon to announce the division of the kingdom, left one tribe (Judah) to the house of David, and assigned ten to Jeroboam. ( 1 Kings 11:31,35 ) These were probably Joseph (Ephraim and Manasseh), Issachar, Zebulun, Asher, Naphtali, Benjamin, Dan, Simeon, Gad and Reuben; Levi being intentionally omitted. Eventually the greater part of Benjamin, and probably the whole of Simeon and Dan, were included as if by common consent in the kingdom of Judah. With respect to the conquests of David, Moab appears to have been attached to the kingdom of Isr'l. ( 2 Kings 3:4 ) so much of Syria as remained subject to Solomon, see ( 1 Kings 11:24 ) would probably be claimed by his successor in the northern kingdom; and Ammon was at one time allied ( 2 Chronicles 20:1 ) we know not how closely or how early, with Moab. The seacoast between Accho and Japho remained in the possession of Isr'l. The whole population may perhaps have amounted to at least three and a half millions. II.  the capitals  .", "Shechem was the first capital of the new kingdom. ( 1 Kings 12:25 ) Subsequently Tirzah became the royal residence, if not the capital, of Jeroboam ( 1 Kings 14:17 ) and of his successors. cf. ( 1 Kings 15:33 ;  16:8,17,23 ) Samaria was chosen by Omri. ( 1 Kings 16:24 ) Jezreel was probably only a royal residence of some of the Isr'litish kings. III.  History  .", "The kingdom of Isr'l lasted 254 years, from B.C. 975 to B.C. 721. The detailed history of the kingdom will be found under the names of its nineteen kings. See chart of the kings of Judah and Isr'l, at the end of the work. A summary view may be taken in four periods: (a) B.C. 975-929. Jeroboam had not sufficient force of character in himself to make a lasting impression on his people. A king, but not a founder of a dynasty, he aimed at nothing beyond securing his present elevation. Baasha, in the midst of the army at Gibbethon, slew the son and successor of Jeroboam; Zimri, a captain of chariots, slew the son and successor of Baasha; Omri, the captain of the host, was chosen to punish Zimri; and after a civil war of four years he prevailed over Tibni, the choice of half the people. (b) B.C. 929-884. For forty-five years Isr'l wag governed by the house of Omri. The princes of his house cultivated an alliance with the king of Judah which was cemented by the marriage of Jehoram and Athaliah. The adoption of Baal-worship led to a reaction in the nation, to the moral triumph of the prophets in the person of Elijah, and to extinction of the house of Ahab in obedience to the bidding of Elisha. (c) B.C. 884-772. Unparalleled triumphs, but deeper humiliation, awaited the kingdom of Isr'l under the dynasty of Jehu. Haz'l, the ablest king of Damascus, reduced Jehoahaz to the condition of a vassal, and triumphed for a time over both the disunited Hebrew kingdoms. Almost the first sign of the restoration of their strength was a war between them; and Jehoash, the grandson of Jehu, entered Jerusalem as the conqueror of Amaziah. Jehoash also turned the tide of war against the Syrians; and Jeroboam II., the most powerful of all the kings of of Isr'l, captured Damascus, and recovered the whole ancient frontier from Hamath to the Dead Sea. This short-lived greatness expired with the last king of Jehu's line. (d) B.C. 772-721. Military violence, it would seem, broke off the hereditary succession after the obscure and probably convulsed reign of Zachariah. An unsuccessful usurper, Shallum, is followed by the cruel Menahem, who, being unable to make head against the first attack of Assyria under Pul, became the agent of that monarch for the oppressive taxation of his subjects. Yet his power at home was sufficient to insure for his son and successor Pekahiah a ten-years reign, cut short by a bold usurper, Pekah. Abandoning the northern and transjordanic regions to the encroaching power of Assyria under Tiglath-pileser, he was very near subjugating Judah, with the help of Damascus, now the coequal ally of Isr'l. But Assyria interposing summarily put an end to the independence of Damascus, and perhaps was the indirect cause of the assassination of the baffled Pekah. The irresolute Hoshea, the next and last usurper, became tributary to his invaders Shalmaneser, betrayed the Assyrian to the rival monarchy of Egypt, and was punished by the loss of his liberty, and by the capture, after a three-years siege, of his strong capital, Samaria. Some gleanings of the ten tribes yet remained in the land after so many years of religious decline, moral debasement, national degradation, anarchy, bloodshed and deportation. Even these were gathered up by the conqueror and carried to Assyria, never again, as a distinct people, to occupy their portion of that goodly and pleasant land which their forefathers won under Joshua from the heathen. (Schaff Bib. Dic.) adds to this summary that \"after the destruction of the kingdom of Isr'l, B.C. 721, the name 'Isr'l' began to be applied to the whole surviving people. No doubt many of the kingdom of Isr'l joined the later kingdom of the Jews after the captivity, and became part of that kingdom.", "ED.)"], "Word": "Israel, Kingdom of", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "7": {"Definitions": ["( descendant of Isr'l ).

( Revelation 8:1 ) and at a signal from the perfect the priest cast the incense on the fire and, bowing reverently toward the holy of holies, retired slowly backward.

The first allusion to idolatry is in the account of Rachel stealing her father's teraphim ( Genesis 31:19 ), which were the relics of the worship of other gods by Laban's progenitors \"on the other side of the river in old time\" ( Joshua 24:2 ). During their long residence in Egypt the Hebrews fell into idolatry, and it was long before they were delivered from it ( Joshua 24:14 ;  Ezekiel 20:7 ). Many a token of God's displeasure fell upon them because of this sin.", "The idolatry learned in Egypt was probably rooted out from among the people during the forty years' wanderings; but when the Jews entered Palestine, they came into contact with the monuments and associations of the idolatry of the old Canaanitish races, and showed a constant tendency to depart from the living God and follow the idolatrous practices of those heathen nations. It was their great national sin, which was only effectually rebuked by the Babylonian exile. That exile finally purified the Jews of all idolatrous tendencies.", "The first and second commandments are directed against idolatry of every form. Individuals and communities were equally amenable to the rigorous code. The individual offender was devoted to destruction ( Exodus 22:20 ). His nearest relatives were not only bound to denounce him and deliver him up to punishment ( Deuteronomy 13:20-10 ), but their hands were to strike the first blow when, on the evidence of two witnesses at least, he was stoned ( Deuteronomy 17:2-7) . To attempt to seduce others to false worship was a crime of equal enormity ( 13:6-10 ). An idolatrous nation shared the same fate. No facts are more strongly declared in the Old Testament than that the extermination of the Canaanites was the punishment of their idolatry ( Exodus 34:15, 16 ;  Deuteronomy 7 ;  12:29-31 ;  20:17 ), and that the calamities of the Israelites were due to the same cause ( Jeremiah 2:17 ). \"A city guilty of idolatry was looked upon as a cancer in the state; it was considered to be in rebellion, and treated according to the laws of war.

I.  History of idolatry among the Jews.", "The first undoubted allusion to idolatry or idolatrous customs in the Bible is in the account of Rachel's stealing her father's teraphim. ( Genesis 31:19 ) During their long residence in Egypt the Isr'lites defiled themselves with the idols of the land, and it was long before the taint was removed. ( Joshua 24:14 ;  Ezekiel 20:7 ) In the wilderness they clamored for some visible shape in which they might worship the God who had brought them out of Egypt. ( Exodus 32:1 ) ... until Aaron made the calf, the embodiment of Apis and emblem of the productive power of nature. During the lives of Joshua and the elders who outlived him they kept true to their allegiance; but the generation following who knew not Jehovah nor the works he had done for Isr'l, swerved from the plain path of their fathers and were caught in the toils of the foreigner. ( Judges 2:1 ) ... From this time forth their history becomes little more than a chronicle of the inevitable sequence of offence and punishment. ( Judges 2:12,14 ) By turns each conquering nation strove to establish the worship of its national God. In later times the practice of secret idolatry was carried to greater lengths. Images were set up on the corn-floors, in the wine-vats, and behind the doors of private houses, ( Isaiah 57:8 ;  Hosea 9:1,2 ) and to check this tendency the statute in ( 27:15 ) was originally promulgated. Under Samuel's administration idolatry was publicly renounced, ( 1 Samuel 7:3-6 ) but in the reign of Solomon all this was forgotten, even Solomon's own heart being turned after other gods. ( 1 Kings 11:14 ) Rehoboam perpetuated the worst features of Solomon's idolatry. ( 1 Kings 14:22-24 ) erected golden calves at Beth-el and at Dan, and by this crafty state' policy severed forever the kingdoms of Judah and Isr'l. ( 1 Kings 12:26-33 ) The successors of Jeroboam followed in his steps, till Ahab. The conquest of the ten tribes by Shalmaneser was for them the last scene Of the drama of abominations which had been enacted uninterruptedly for upwards of 250 years. Under Hezekiah a great reform was inaugurated, that was not confined to Judah and Benjamin, but spread throughout Ephraim and Manasseh. ( 2 Chronicles 31:1 ) and to all external appearances idolatry was extirpated. But the reform extended little below the surface. ( Isaiah 29:13 ) With the death of Josiah ended the last effort to revive among the people a purer ritual. If not a purer faith. The lamp of David, which had long shed but a struggling ray, flickered for a while and then went out in the darkness of Babylonian Captivity. Though the conquests of Alexander caused Greek influence to be felt, yet after the captivity better condition of things prevailed, and the Jews never again fell into idolatry. The erection of synagogues had been assigned as a reason for the comparative purity of the Jewish worship after the captivity, while another cause has been discovered in the hatred for images acquired by the Jews in their intercourse with the Persians. II.  Objects of idolatry  .", "The sun and moon were early selected as outward symbols of all-pervading power, and the worship of the heavenly bodies was not only the most ancient but the most prevalent system of idolatry. Taking its rise in the plains of Chaldea, it spread through Egypt, Greece, Scythia, and even Mexico and Ceylon. Comp. ( 4:19 ;  17:3 ;  Job 31:20-28 ) In the later times of the monarchy, the planets or the zodiacal signs received, next to the sun and moon, their share of popular adoration. ( 2 Kings 23:5 ) Beast-worship, as exemplified in the calves of Jeroboam, has already been alluded to of pure hero-worship among the Semitic races we find no trace. The singular reverence with which trees have been honored is not without example in the history of the Hebrew. The terebinth (oak) at Mamre, beneath which Abraham built an altar, ( Genesis 12:7 ;  13:18 ) and the memorial grove planted by him at Beersheba, ( Genesis 21:33 ) were intimately connected with patriarchal worship. Mountains and high places were chosen spots for offering sacrifice and incense to idols, ( 1 Kings 11:7 ;  14:23 ) and the retirement of gardens and the thick shade of woods offered great attractions to their worshippers. ( 2 Kings 16:4 ;  Isaiah 1:29 ;  Hosea 4:13 ) The host of heaven was worshipped on the house-top. ( 2 Kings 23:12 ;  Jeremiah 19:3 ;  32:29 ;  Zephaniah 1:5 ) (The modern objects of idolatry are less gross than the ancient, but are none the less idols. Whatever of wealth or honor or pleasure is loved and sought before God and righteousness becomes an object of idolatry.", "ED.) III.  Punishment of idolatry  .", "Idolatry to an Isr'lite was a state offence, ( 1 Samuel 15:23 ) a political crime of the greatest character, high treason against the majesty of his king. The first and second commandments are directed against idolatry of every form. Individuals and communities were equally amenable to the rigorous code. The individual offender was devoted to destruction, ( Exodus 22:20 ) his nearest relatives were not only bound to denounce him and deliver him up to punishment, ( 13:2-10 ) but their hands were to strike the first blow, when, on the evidence of two witnesses at least, he was stoned. ( 17:2-5 ) To attempt to seduce others to false worship was a crime of equal enormity. ( 13:6-10 ) IV.  Attractions of idolatry  .", "Many have wondered why the Isr'lites were so easily led away from the true God, into the worship of idols. (1) Visible, outward signs, with shows, pageants, parades, have an attraction to the natural heart, which often fail to perceive the unseen spiritual realities. (2) But the greatest attraction seems to have been in licentious revelries and obscene orgies with which the worship of the Oriental idols was observed. This worship, appealing to every sensual passion, joined with the attractions of wealth and fashion and luxury, naturally was a great temptation to a simple, restrained, agricultural people, whose worship and law demands the greatest purity of heart and of life.", "ED.)"], "Word": "Idolatry", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "4": {"Definitions": ["IDOL'ATRY ,  noun   [Latin  idololatria.
