In the Old Testament the Hebrew word berith is always thus translated. Berith is derived from a root which means \"to cut,\" and hence a covenant is a \"cutting,\" with reference to the cutting or dividing of animals into two parts, and the contracting parties passing between them, in making a covenant (Genesis 15;  Jeremiah 34:18, 19 ).", "The corresponding word in the New Testament Greek is diatheke, which is, however, rendered \"testament\" generally in the Authorized Version. It ought to be rendered, just as the word berith of the Old Testament, \"covenant.\"", "This word is used (1) of a covenant or compact between man and man ( Genesis 21:32 ), or between tribes or nations ( 1 Samuel 11:1 ;  Joshua 9:6, 15 ). In entering into a convenant, Jehovah was solemnly called on to witness the transaction ( Genesis 31:50 ), and hence it was called a \"covenant of the Lord\" ( 1 Samuel 20:8 ). The marriage compact is called \"the covenant of God\" ( Proverbs 2:17 ), because the marriage was made in God's name. Wicked men are spoken of as acting as if they had made a \"covenant with death\" not to destroy them, or with hell not to devour them ( Isaiah 28:15, 18 ).", "2.  The word is used with reference to God's revelation of himself in the way of promise or of favour to men. Thus God's promise to Noah after the Flood is called a covenant (Genesis 9;  Jeremiah 33:20 , \"my covenant\"). We have an account of God's covernant with Abraham (Genesis 17, comp.  Leviticus 26:42 ), of the covenant of the priesthood ( Numbers 25:12, 13 ;  Deuteronomy 33:9 ;  Nehemiah 13:29 ), and of the covenant of Sinai ( Exodus 34:27, 28 ;  Leviticus 26:15 ), which was afterwards renewed at different times in the history of Israel (Deuteronomy 29;  Joshua 1:24 ; 2 Chronicles 15; 23; 29; 34; Ezra 10; Nehemiah 9). In conformity with human custom, God's covenant is said to be confirmed with an oath ( Deuteronomy 4:31 ;  Psalms 89:3 ), and to be accompanied by a sign (Genesis 9; 17). Hence the covenant is called God's \"counsel,\" \"oath,\" \"promise\" ( Psalms 89:3, 4 ;  105:8 -11;  Hebrews 6:13-20 ;  Luke 1:68-75 ). God's covenant consists wholly in the bestowal of blessing ( Isaiah 59:21 ;  Jeremiah 31:33, 34 ).", "The term covenant is also used to designate the regular succession of day and night ( Jeremiah 33:20 ), the Sabbath ( Exodus 31:16 ), circumcision ( Genesis 17:9, 10 ), and in general any ordinance of God ( Jeremiah 34:13, 14 ).", "A \"covenant of salt\" signifies an everlasting covenant, in the sealing or ratifying of which salt, as an emblem of perpetuity, is used ( Numbers 18:19 ;  Leviticus 2:13 ;  2 Chronicles 13:5 ).", "COVENANT OF WORKS, the constitution under which Adam was placed at his creation. In this covenant,", "1.  The contracting parties were (a) God the moral Governor, and (b) Adam, a free moral agent, and representative of all his natural posterity ( Romans 5:12-19 ).", "2.  The promise was \"life\" ( Matthew 19:16, 17 ;  Galatians 3:12 ).", "3.  The condition was perfect obedience to the law, the test in this case being abstaining from eating the fruit of the \"tree of knowledge,\" etc.", "4.  The penalty was death ( Genesis 2:16, 17 ).", "This covenant is also called a covenant of nature, as made with man in his natural or unfallen state; a covenant of life, because \"life\" was the promise attached to obedience; and a legal covenant, because it demanded perfect obedience to the law.", "The \"tree of life\" was the outward sign and seal of that life which was promised in the covenant, and hence it is usually called the seal of that covenant.", "This covenant is abrogated under the gospel, inasmuch as Christ has fulfilled all its conditions in behalf of his people, and now offers salvation on the condition of faith. It is still in force, however, as it rests on the immutable justice of God, and is binding on all who have not fled to Christ and accepted his righteousness.", "COVENANT OF GRACE, the eternal plan of redemption entered into by the three persons of the Godhead, and carried out by them in its several parts.

It ought to be rendered, just as the word berith of the Old Testament, \"covenant.\"", "This word is used (1) of a covenant or compact between man and man ( Genesis 21:32 ), or between tribes or nations ( 1 Samuel 11:1 ;  Joshua 9:6, 15 ). In entering into a convenant, Jehovah was solemnly called on to witness the transaction ( Genesis 31:50 ), and hence it was called a \"covenant of the Lord\" ( 1 Samuel 20:8 ). The marriage compact is called \"the covenant of God\" ( Proverbs 2:17 ), because the marriage was made in God's name. Wicked men are spoken of as acting as if they had made a \"covenant with death\" not to destroy them, or with hell not to devour them ( Isaiah 28:15, 18 ).", "2.  The word is used with reference to God's revelation of himself in the way of promise or of favour to men. Thus God's promise to Noah after the Flood is called a covenant (Genesis 9;  Jeremiah 33:20 , \"my covenant\"). We have an account of God's covernant with Abraham (Genesis 17, comp.  Leviticus 26:42 ), of the covenant of the priesthood ( Numbers 25:12, 13 ;  Deuteronomy 33:9 ;  Nehemiah 13:29 ), and of the covenant of Sinai ( Exodus 34:27, 28 ;  Leviticus 26:15 ), which was afterwards renewed at different times in the history of Israel (Deuteronomy 29;  Joshua 1:24 ; 2 Chronicles 15; 23; 29; 34; Ezra 10; Nehemiah 9). In conformity with human custom, God's covenant is said to be confirmed with an oath ( Deuteronomy 4:31 ;  Psalms 89:3 ), and to be accompanied by a sign (Genesis 9; 17). Hence the covenant is called God's \"counsel,\" \"oath,\" \"promise\" ( Psalms 89:3, 4 ;  105:8 -11;  Hebrews 6:13-20 ;  Luke 1:68-75 ). God's covenant consists wholly in the bestowal of blessing ( Isaiah 59:21 ;  Jeremiah 31:33, 34 ).", "The term covenant is also used to designate the regular succession of day and night ( Jeremiah 33:20 ), the Sabbath ( Exodus 31:16 ), circumcision ( Genesis 17:9, 10 ), and in general any ordinance of God ( Jeremiah 34:13, 14 ).", "A \"covenant of salt\" signifies an everlasting covenant, in the sealing or ratifying of which salt, as an emblem of perpetuity, is used ( Numbers 18:19 ;  Leviticus 2:13 ;  2 Chronicles 13:5 ).", "COVENANT OF WORKS, the constitution under which Adam was placed at his creation.

The penalty was death ( Genesis 2:16, 17 ).", "This covenant is also called a covenant of nature, as made with man in his natural or unfallen state; a covenant of life, because \"life\" was the promise attached to obedience; and a legal covenant, because it demanded perfect obedience to the law.", "The \"tree of life\" was the outward sign and seal of that life which was promised in the covenant, and hence it is usually called the seal of that covenant.", "This covenant is abrogated under the gospel, inasmuch as Christ has fulfilled all its conditions in behalf of his people, and now offers salvation on the condition of faith.

There is no clear instance of its being used for a place of meeting or of worship, although in post-apostolic times it early received this meaning. Nor is this word ever used to denote the inhabitants of a country united in the same profession, as when we say the \"Church of England,\" the \"Church of Scotland,\" etc.", "We find the word ecclesia used in the following senses in the New Testament:", "1.  It is translated \"assembly\" in the ordinary classical sense ( Acts 19:32 ,  39 ,  41 ).", "2.  It denotes the whole body of the redeemed, all those whom the Father has given to Christ, the invisible catholic church ( Ephesians 5:23 ,  25 ,  27 ,  29 ;  Hebrews 12:23 ).", "3.  A few Christians associated together in observing the ordinances of the gospel are an ecclesia ( Romans 16:5 ;  Colossians 4:15 ).", "4.  All the Christians in a particular city, whether they assembled together in one place or in several places for religious worship, were an ecclesia. Thus all the disciples in Antioch, forming several congregations, were one church ( Acts 13:1 ); so also we read of the \"church of God at Corinth\" ( 1 Corinthians 1:2 ), \"the church at Jerusalem\" ( Acts 8:1 ), \"the church of Ephesus\" ( Revelation 2:1 ), etc.", "5.

Here there is a mixture of \"wheat and chaff,\" of saints and sinners. \"God has commanded his people to organize themselves into distinct visible ecclesiastical communities, with constitutions, laws, and officers, badges, ordinances, and discipline, for the great purpose of giving visibility to his kingdom, of making known the gospel of that kingdom, and of gathering in all its elect subjects. Each one of these distinct organized communities which is faithful to the great King is an integral part of the visible church, and all together constitute the catholic or universal visible church.\" A credible profession of the true religion constitutes a person a member of this church. This is \"the kingdom of heaven,\" whose character and progress are set forth in the parables recorded in Matthew 13.", "The children of all who thus profess the true religion are members of the visible church along with their parents. Children are included in every covenant God ever made with man. They go along with their parents ( Genesis 9:9-17 ;  12:1-3 ;  17:7 ;  Exodus 20:5 ;  Deuteronomy 29:10-13 ). Peter, on the day of Pentecost, at the beginning of the New Testament dispensation, announces the same great principle. \"The promise [just as to Abraham and his seed the promises were made] is unto you, and to your children\" ( Acts 2:38, 39 ). The children of believing parents are \"holy\", i.e., are \"saints\", a title which designates the members of the Christian church ( 1 Corinthians 7:14 ). (See  BAPTISM .)", "The church invisible \"consists of the whole number of the elect that have been, are, or shall be gathered into one under Christ, the head thereof.\" This is a pure society, the church in which Christ dwells. It is the body of Christ. it is called \"invisible\" because the greater part of those who constitute it are already in heaven or are yet unborn, and also because its members still on earth cannot certainly be distinguished. The qualifications of membership in it are internal and are hidden. It is unseen except by Him who \"searches the heart.\" \"The Lord knoweth them that are his\" ( 2 Timothy 2:19 ).", "The church to which the attributes, prerogatives, and promises appertaining to Christ's kingdom belong, is a spiritual body consisting of all true believers, i.e., the church invisible.", "1.

The Old Testament church was not to be changed but enlarged ( Isaiah 49:13-23 ;  60:1-14 ). When the Jews are at length restored, they will not enter a new church, but will be grafted again into \"their own olive tree\" ( Romans 11:18-24 ; comp.  Ephesians 2:11-22 ). The apostles did not set up a new organization. Under their ministry disciples were \"added\" to the \"church\" already existing ( Acts 2:47 ).", "2.  Its universality. It is the \"catholic\" church; not confined to any particular country or outward organization, but comprehending all believers throughout the whole world.", "3.  Its perpetuity.

They were written by the finger of God on two tables of stone. The first tables were broken by Moses when he brought them down from the mount ( 32:19 ), being thrown by him on the ground. At the command of God he took up into the mount two other tables, and God wrote on them \"the words that were on the first tables\" ( 34:1 ). These tables were afterwards placed in the ark of the covenant ( Deuteronomy 10:5 ;  1 Kings 8:9 ). Their subsequent history is unknown. They are as a whole called \"the covenant\" ( Deuteronomy 4:13 ), and \"the tables of the covenant\" ( 9:9, 11 ;  Hebrews 9:4 ), and \"the testimony.\"", "They are obviously \"ten\" in number, but their division is not fixed, hence different methods of numbering them have been adopted. The Jews make the \"Preface\" one of the commandments, and then combine the first and second. The Roman Catholics and Lutherans combine the first and second and divide the tenth into two. The Jews and Josephus divide them equally. The Lutherans and Roman Catholics refer three commandments to the first table and seven to the second.

( Acts 18:11 ) A short time after the apostle had left the city the eloquent Jew of Alexandria, Apollos, went to Corinth, ( Acts 19:1 ) and gained many followers, dividing the church into two parties, the followers of Paul and the followers of Apollos. Later on Judaizing teachers from Jerusalem preached the gospel in a spirit of direct antagonism to St. Paul  personally.  To this third party we may perhaps add a fourth, that, under the name of \"the followers of Christ,\" ( 1 Corinthians 2:12 ) sought at first to separate themselves from the factious adherence to particular teachers, but eventually were driven by antagonism into positions equally sectarian and inimical to the unity of the church.

He then left Troas and proceeded to Macedonia; and at Philippi, where he tarried, he was soon joined by Titus ( 2 Corinthians 7:6, 7 ), who brought him good news from Corinth, and also by Timothy. Under the influence of the feelings awakened in his mind by the favourable report which Titus brought back from Corinth, this second epistle was written. It was probably written at Philippi, or, as some think, Thessalonica, early in the year A.D. 58, and was sent to Corinth by Titus.

The crown or wreath worn by the victors in the Olympic games was made of leaves of the wild olive; in the Pythian games, of laurel; in the Nemean games, of parsley; and in the Isthmian games, of the pine. The Romans bestowed the \"civic crown\" on him who saved the life of a citizen. It was made of the leaves of the oak.
