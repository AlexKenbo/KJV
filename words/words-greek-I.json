The first allusion to idolatry is in the account of Rachel stealing her father's teraphim ( Genesis 31:19 ), which were the relics of the worship of other gods by Laban's progenitors \"on the other side of the river in old time\" ( Joshua 24:2 ). During their long residence in Egypt the Hebrews fell into idolatry, and it was long before they were delivered from it ( Joshua 24:14 ;  Ezekiel 20:7 ). Many a token of God's displeasure fell upon them because of this sin.", "The idolatry learned in Egypt was probably rooted out from among the people during the forty years' wanderings; but when the Jews entered Palestine, they came into contact with the monuments and associations of the idolatry of the old Canaanitish races, and showed a constant tendency to depart from the living God and follow the idolatrous practices of those heathen nations. It was their great national sin, which was only effectually rebuked by the Babylonian exile. That exile finally purified the Jews of all idolatrous tendencies.", "The first and second commandments are directed against idolatry of every form. Individuals and communities were equally amenable to the rigorous code. The individual offender was devoted to destruction ( Exodus 22:20 ). His nearest relatives were not only bound to denounce him and deliver him up to punishment ( Deuteronomy 13:20-10 ), but their hands were to strike the first blow when, on the evidence of two witnesses at least, he was stoned ( Deuteronomy 17:2-7) . To attempt to seduce others to false worship was a crime of equal enormity ( 13:6-10 ). An idolatrous nation shared the same fate. No facts are more strongly declared in the Old Testament than that the extermination of the Canaanites was the punishment of their idolatry ( Exodus 34:15, 16 ;  Deuteronomy 7 ;  12:29-31 ;  20:17 ), and that the calamities of the Israelites were due to the same cause ( Jeremiah 2:17 ). \"A city guilty of idolatry was looked upon as a cancer in the state; it was considered to be in rebellion, and treated according to the laws of war. Its inhabitants and all their cattle were put to death.\" Jehovah was the theocratic King of Israel, the civil Head of the commonwealth, and therefore to an Israelite idolatry was a state offence ( 1 Samuel 15:23 ), high treason. On taking possession of the land, the Jews were commanded to destroy all traces of every kind of the existing idolatry of the Canaanites ( Exodus 23:24, 32 ;  34:13 ;  Deuteronomy 7:5, 25 ;  12:1-3 ).", "In the New Testament the term idolatry is used to designate covetousness ( Matthew 6:24 ;

I.  History of idolatry among the Jews.", "The first undoubted allusion to idolatry or idolatrous customs in the Bible is in the account of Rachel's stealing her father's teraphim. ( Genesis 31:19 ) During their long residence in Egypt the Isr'lites defiled themselves with the idols of the land, and it was long before the taint was removed. ( Joshua 24:14 ;  Ezekiel 20:7 ) In the wilderness they clamored for some visible shape in which they might worship the God who had brought them out of Egypt. ( Exodus 32:1 ) ... until Aaron made the calf, the embodiment of Apis and emblem of the productive power of nature. During the lives of Joshua and the elders who outlived him they kept true to their allegiance; but the generation following who knew not Jehovah nor the works he had done for Isr'l, swerved from the plain path of their fathers and were caught in the toils of the foreigner. ( Judges 2:1 ) ... From this time forth their history becomes little more than a chronicle of the inevitable sequence of offence and punishment. ( Judges 2:12,14 ) By turns each conquering nation strove to establish the worship of its national God. In later times the practice of secret idolatry was carried to greater lengths. Images were set up on the corn-floors, in the wine-vats, and behind the doors of private houses, ( Isaiah 57:8 ;  Hosea 9:1,2 ) and to check this tendency the statute in ( 27:15 ) was originally promulgated. Under Samuel's administration idolatry was publicly renounced, ( 1 Samuel 7:3-6 ) but in the reign of Solomon all this was forgotten, even Solomon's own heart being turned after other gods. ( 1 Kings 11:14 ) Rehoboam perpetuated the worst features of Solomon's idolatry. ( 1 Kings 14:22-24 ) erected golden calves at Beth-el and at Dan, and by this crafty state' policy severed forever the kingdoms of Judah and Isr'l. ( 1 Kings 12:26-33 ) The successors of Jeroboam followed in his steps, till Ahab. The conquest of the ten tribes by Shalmaneser was for them the last scene Of the drama of abominations which had been enacted uninterruptedly for upwards of 250 years. Under Hezekiah a great reform was inaugurated, that was not confined to Judah and Benjamin, but spread throughout Ephraim and Manasseh. ( 2 Chronicles 31:1 ) and to all external appearances idolatry was extirpated. But the reform extended little below the surface. ( Isaiah 29:13 ) With the death of Josiah ended the last effort to revive among the people a purer ritual. If not a purer faith. The lamp of David, which had long shed but a struggling ray, flickered for a while and then went out in the darkness of Babylonian Captivity. Though the conquests of Alexander caused Greek influence to be felt, yet after the captivity better condition of things prevailed, and the Jews never again fell into idolatry. The erection of synagogues had been assigned as a reason for the comparative purity of the Jewish worship after the captivity, while another cause has been discovered in the hatred for images acquired by the Jews in their intercourse with the Persians. II.  Objects of idolatry  .", "The sun and moon were early selected as outward symbols of all-pervading power, and the worship of the heavenly bodies was not only the most ancient but the most prevalent system of idolatry. Taking its rise in the plains of Chaldea, it spread through Egypt, Greece, Scythia, and even Mexico and Ceylon. Comp. ( 4:19 ;  17:3 ;  Job 31:20-28 ) In the later times of the monarchy, the planets or the zodiacal signs received, next to the sun and moon, their share of popular adoration. ( 2 Kings 23:5 ) Beast-worship, as exemplified in the calves of Jeroboam, has already been alluded to of pure hero-worship among the Semitic races we find no trace. The singular reverence with which trees have been honored is not without example in the history of the Hebrew. The terebinth (oak) at Mamre, beneath which Abraham built an altar, ( Genesis 12:7 ;  13:18 ) and the memorial grove planted by him at Beersheba, ( Genesis 21:33 ) were intimately connected with patriarchal worship. Mountains and high places were chosen spots for offering sacrifice and incense to idols, ( 1 Kings 11:7 ;  14:23 ) and the retirement of gardens and the thick shade of woods offered great attractions to their worshippers. ( 2 Kings 16:4 ;  Isaiah 1:29 ;  Hosea 4:13 ) The host of heaven was worshipped on the house-top. ( 2 Kings 23:12 ;  Jeremiah 19:3 ;  32:29 ;  Zephaniah 1:5 ) (The modern objects of idolatry are less gross than the ancient, but are none the less idols. Whatever of wealth or honor or pleasure is loved and sought before God and righteousness becomes an object of idolatry.", "ED.) III.  Punishment of idolatry  .", "Idolatry to an Isr'lite was a state offence, ( 1 Samuel 15:23 ) a political crime of the greatest character, high treason against the majesty of his king. The first and second commandments are directed against idolatry of every form. Individuals and communities were equally amenable to the rigorous code. The individual offender was devoted to destruction, ( Exodus 22:20 ) his nearest relatives were not only bound to denounce him and deliver him up to punishment, ( 13:2-10 ) but their hands were to strike the first blow, when, on the evidence of two witnesses at least, he was stoned. ( 17:2-5 ) To attempt to seduce others to false worship was a crime of equal enormity. ( 13:6-10 ) IV.  Attractions of idolatry  .", "Many have wondered why the Isr'lites were so easily led away from the true God, into the worship of idols. (1) Visible, outward signs, with shows, pageants, parades, have an attraction to the natural heart, which often fail to perceive the unseen spiritual realities. (2) But the greatest attraction seems to have been in licentious revelries and obscene orgies with which the worship of the Oriental idols was observed. This worship, appealing to every sensual passion, joined with the attractions of wealth and fashion and luxury, naturally was a great temptation to a simple, restrained, agricultural people, whose worship and law demands the greatest purity of heart and of life.", "ED.)"], "Word": "Idolatry", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "4": {"Definitions": ["IDOL'ATRY ,  noun   [Latin  idololatria.
