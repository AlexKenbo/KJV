His name stands first on the list of prophets and teachers of the church at Antioch ( 13:1 ). Luke speaks of him as a \"good man\" ( 11:24 ). He was born of Jewish parents of the tribe of Levi. He was a native of Cyprus, where he had a possession of land ( Acts 4:36, 37 ), which he sold. His personal appearance is supposed to have been dignified and commanding ( Acts 14:11, 12 ). When Paul returned to Jerusalem after his conversion, Barnabas took him and introduced him to the apostles ( 9:27 ). They had probably been companions as students in the school of Gamaliel.", "The prosperity of the church at Antioch led the apostles and brethren at Jerusalem to send Barnabas thither to superintend the movement. He found the work so extensive and weighty that he went to Tarsus in search of Saul to assist him. Saul returned with him to Antioch and laboured with him for a whole year ( Acts 11:25, 26 ). The two were at the end of this period sent up to Jerusalem with the contributions the church at Antioch had made for the poorer brethren there ( 11:28-30 ). Shortly after they returned, bringing John Mark with them, they were appointed as missionaries to the heathen world, and in this capacity visited Cyprus and some of the principal cities of Asia Minor ( Acts 13:14 ). Returning from this first missionary journey to Antioch, they were again sent up to Jerusalem to consult with the church there regarding the relation of Gentiles to the church ( Acts 15:2 :  Galatians 2:1 ). This matter having been settled, they returned again to Antioch, bringing the decree of the council as the rule by which Gentiles were to be admitted into the church.", "When about to set forth on a second missionary journey, a dispute arose between Saul and Barnabas as to the propriety of taking John Mark with them again.

It stood on the Euphrates, about 200 miles above its junction with the Tigris, which flowed through its midst and divided it into two almost equal parts. The Elamites invaded Chaldea (i.e., Lower Mesopotamia, or Shinar, and Upper Mesopotamia, or Accad, now combined into one) and held it in subjection. At length Khammu-rabi delivered it from the foreign yoke, and founded the new empire of Chaldea (q.v.), making Babylon the capital of the united kingdom. This city gradually grew in extent and grandeur, but in process of time it became subject to Assyria.

This was put an end to by Khammu-rabi (Amraphel), who drove the Elamites out of the country, and overcame Arioch, the son of an Elamite prince. From this time forward Babylonia was a united monarchy.

I.  Topography of Babylon", "Ancient description of the city.", "All the ancient writers appear to agree in the fact of a district of vast size, more or less inhabited having been enclosed within lofty walls and included under the name of Babylon. With respect to the exact extent of the circuit they differ. The estimate of Herodotus and of Pliny is 480 stades (60 Roman miles, 53 of our miles) of Strabo 385, of Q. Curtius 368, of Clitarchus 365 and of Ctesias 360 stades (40 miles). (George Smith, in his \"Assyrian Discoveries,\" differs entirely from all these estimates, making the circuit of the city but  eight  miles.) Perhaps Herodotus spoke of the outer wall, which could be traced in his time. Taking the lowest estimate of the extent of the circuit, we shall have for the space within the rampart an area of above 100 square miles", "nearly five times the size of London! It is evident that this vast space cannot have been entirely covered with houses. The city was situated on both sides of the river Euphrates, and the two parts were connected together by a stone bridge five stades (above 1000 yards) long and 30 feet broad. At either extremity of the bridge was a royal palace, that in the eastern city being the more magnificent of the two. The two palaces were joined not only by the bridge, but by a tunnel under the river. The houses, which were frequently three or four stories high, were laid out in straight streets crossing each other at right angles. II.  Present state of the ruins.", "A portion of the ruins is occupied by the modern town of  Hillah  . About five miles above Hillah, on the opposite or left bank of the Euphrates occurs a series of artificial mounds of enormous size. They consist chiefly of three great masses of building,", "the high pile of unbaked brickwork which is known to the Arabs as Babel, 600 feet square and 140 feet high; the building denominated the  Kasr  or palace, nearly 2000 feet square and 70 feet high, and a lofty mound upon which stands the modern tomb of  Amram-ibn-'Alb  . Scattered over the country on both sides of the Euphrates are a number of remarkable mounds, usually standing single, which are plainly of the same date with the great mass of ruins upon the river bank. Of these by far the most striking is the vast ruin called the  Birs-Nimrud  , which many regard as the tower of Babel, situated about six miles to the southwest of Hillah. [ BABEL, TOWER OF ] III.  Identification of sites.", "The great mound of Babel is probably the ancient temple of Beaus. The mound of the  Kasr  marks the site of the great palace of Nebuchadnezzar. The mound of  Amram  is thought to represent the \"hanging gardens\" of Nebuchadnezzar; but most probably it represents the ancient palace, coeval with Babylon itself, of which Nebuchadnezzar speaks in his inscriptions as adjoining his own more magnificent residence. IV.  History of Babylon.", "Scripture represents the \"beginning of the kingdom\" as belonging to the time of Nimrod. ( Genesis 10:6-10 ) The early annals of Babylon are filled by Berosus, the native historian, with three dynasties: one of 49 Chaldean kings, who reigned 458 years; another of 9 Arab kings, who reigned 245 years; and a third of 49 Assyrian monarchs, who held dominion for 526 years. The line of Babylonian kings becomes exactly known to us from B.C. 747. The \"Canon of Ptolemy\" gives us the succession of Babylonian monarchs from B.C. 747 to B.C. 331, when the last Persian king was dethroned by Alexander. On the fall of Nineveh, B.C. 625, Babylon became not only an independent kingdom, but an empire. The city was taken by surprise B.C. 539, as Jeremiah had prophesied, ( Jeremiah 51:31 ) by Cyrus, under Darius, Dan. 5, as intimated 170 years earlier by Isaiah, ( Isaiah 21:1-9 ) and, as Jeremiah had also foreshown, ( Jeremiah 51:39 ) during a festival. With the conquest of Cyrus commenced the decay of Babylon, which has since been a quarry from which all the tribes in the vicinity have derived the bricks with which they have built their cities. The \"great city\" has thus emphatically \"become heaps.\" ( Jeremiah 51:37 )  Ba'bel, Tower of.  The \"tower of Babel\" is only mentioned once in Scripture, ( Genesis 11:4,5 ) and then as incomplete. It was built of bricks, and the \"slime\" used for mortar was probably bitumen. Such authorities as we possess represent the building as destroyed soon after its erection. When the Jews, however, were carried captive into Babylonia, they thought they recognized it in the famous temple of Beaus, the modern  Birs Nimrod  .

A place in Central Palestine, about 10 miles north of Jerusalem, at the head of the pass of Michmash and Ai. It was originally the royal Canaanite city of Luz ( Genesis 28:19 ). The name Bethel was at first apparently given to the sanctuary in the neighbourhood of Luz, and was not given to the city itself till after its conquest by the tribe of Ephraim. When Abram entered Canaan he formed his second encampment between Bethel and Hai ( Genesis 12:8 ); and on his return from Egypt he came back to it, and again \"called upon the name of the Lord\" ( 13:4 ). Here Jacob, on his way from Beersheba to Haran, had a vision of the angels of God ascending and descending on the ladder whose top reached unto heaven ( 28:10, 19 ); and on his return he again visited this place, \"where God talked with him\" ( 35:1-15 ), and there he \"built an altar, and called the place El-beth-el\" (q.v.).

Here the ark of the covenant was kept for a long time under the care of Phinehas, the grandson of Aaron ( 20:26-28 ). Here also Samuel held in rotation his court of justice ( 1 Samuel 7:16 ). It was included in Israel after the kingdom was divided, and it became one of the seats of the worship of the golden calf ( 1 Kings 12:28-33 ;  13:1 ). Hence the prophet Hosea ( Hosea 4:15 ;  5:8 ;  10:5, 8 ) calls it in contempt Beth-aven, i.e., \"house of idols.\" Bethel remained an abode of priests even after the kingdom of Israel was desolated by the king of Assyria ( 2 Kings 17:28, 29 ). At length all traces of the idolatries were extirpated by Josiah, king of Judah ( 2 Kings 23:15-18 ); and the place was still in existence after the Captivity ( Ezra 2:28 ;  Nehemiah 7:32 ).

It is evident that though dwelling among idolaters he had some knowledge of the true God; and was held in such reputation that it was supposed that he whom he blessed was blessed, and he whom he cursed was cursed. When the Israelites were encamped on the plains of Moab, on the east of Jordan, by Jericho, Balak sent for Balaam \"from Aram, out of the mountains of the east,\" to curse them; but by the remarkable interposition of God he was utterly unable to fulfil Balak's wish, however desirous he was to do so. The apostle Peter refers ( 2 Peter 2:15, 16 ) to this as an historical event. In  Micah 6:5  reference also is made to the relations between Balaam and Balak. Though Balaam could not curse Israel, yet he suggested a mode by which the divine displeasure might be caused to descend upon them (Numbers 25). In a battle between Israel and the Midianites (q.v.)

Such was his reputation that when the Isr'lites were encamped in the plains of Moab, Balak, the king of Moab, sent for Balaam to curse them. Balaam at first was prohibited by God from going. He was again sent for by the king and again refused, but was at length allowed to go. He yielded to the temptations of riches and honor which Balak set before him; but God's anger was kindled at this manifestation of determined self-will, and the angel of the Lord stood in the way for an adversary against him.

The flat bones are compact externally, and cellular internally. The bones in a fetus are soft and cartilaginous, but they gradually harden with age. The ends of the long bones are larger than the middle, which renders the articulations more firm, and in the fetus are distinct portions, called epiphyses. Bones are supplied with blood vessels, and in the fetus, or in a diseased state, are very vascular. They are probably also furnished with nerves and absorbents, though less easily detected in a sound state. They are covered with a thin, strong membrane, called the periosteum, which, together with the bones, has very little sensibility in a sound state, but when inflamed, is extremely sensible. Their cells and cavities are occupied by a fatty substance, called the medulla or marrow.

A firm hard substance of a dull white color, composing some part of the frame of an animal body. The bones of an animal support all the softer parts, as the flesh and vessels. They vary in texture in different bones, and in different parts of the same  bone   The long bones are compact in their middle portion, with a central cavity occupied by a network of plates and fibers, and cellular or spongy at the extremities. The flat bones are compact externally, and cellular internally. The bones in a fetus are soft and cartilaginous, but they gradually harden with age. The ends of the long bones are larger than the middle, which renders the articulations more firm, and in the fetus are distinct portions, called epiphyses. Bones are supplied with blood vessels, and in the fetus, or in a diseased state, are very vascular. They are probably also furnished with nerves and absorbents, though less easily detected in a sound state. They are covered with a thin, strong membrane, called the periosteum, which, together with the bones, has very little sensibility in a sound state, but when inflamed, is extremely sensible. Their cells and cavities are occupied by a fatty substance, called the medulla or marrow. They consist of earthy matter, rather more than half, gelatin, one sixteenth, and cartilage, about one third of the whole.

His name stands first on the list of prophets and teachers of the church at Antioch ( 13:1 ). Luke speaks of him as a \"good man\" ( 11:24 ). He was born of Jewish parents of the tribe of Levi. He was a native of Cyprus, where he had a possession of land ( Acts 4:36, 37 ), which he sold. His personal appearance is supposed to have been dignified and commanding ( Acts 14:11, 12 ). When Paul returned to Jerusalem after his conversion, Barnabas took him and introduced him to the apostles ( 9:27 ). They had probably been companions as students in the school of Gamaliel.", "The prosperity of the church at Antioch led the apostles and brethren at Jerusalem to send Barnabas thither to superintend the movement. He found the work so extensive and weighty that he went to Tarsus in search of Saul to assist him. Saul returned with him to Antioch and laboured with him for a whole year ( Acts 11:25, 26 ). The two were at the end of this period sent up to Jerusalem with the contributions the church at Antioch had made for the poorer brethren there ( 11:28-30 ).

The injunction to abstain from blood is renewed in the decree of the council of Jerusalem ( Acts 15:29 ). It has been held by some, and we think correctly, that this law of prohibition was only ceremonial and temporary; while others regard it as still binding on all.

At the giving of the law ( Exodus 24:8 ) the blood of the sacrifices was sprinkled on the people as well as on the altar, and thus the people were consecrated to God, or entered into covenant with him, hence the blood of the covenant ( Matthew 26:28 ;  Hebrews 9:19, 20 ;  10:29 ;  13:20 ).", "3.

To \"wash the feet in blood\" means to gain a great victory ( Psalms 58:10 ). Wine, from its red colour, is called \"the blood of the grape\" ( Genesis 49:11 ). Blood and water issued from our Saviour's side when it was pierced by the Roman soldier ( John 19:34 ).

I.  Topography of Babylon", "Ancient description of the city.", "All the ancient writers appear to agree in the fact of a district of vast size, more or less inhabited having been enclosed within lofty walls and included under the name of Babylon. With respect to the exact extent of the circuit they differ. The estimate of Herodotus and of Pliny is 480 stades (60 Roman miles, 53 of our miles) of Strabo 385, of Q. Curtius 368, of Clitarchus 365 and of Ctesias 360 stades (40 miles). (George Smith, in his \"Assyrian Discoveries,\" differs entirely from all these estimates, making the circuit of the city but  eight  miles.) Perhaps Herodotus spoke of the outer wall, which could be traced in his time. Taking the lowest estimate of the extent of the circuit, we shall have for the space within the rampart an area of above 100 square miles", "nearly five times the size of London! It is evident that this vast space cannot have been entirely covered with houses. The city was situated on both sides of the river Euphrates, and the two parts were connected together by a stone bridge five stades (above 1000 yards) long and 30 feet broad. At either extremity of the bridge was a royal palace, that in the eastern city being the more magnificent of the two. The two palaces were joined not only by the bridge, but by a tunnel under the river. The houses, which were frequently three or four stories high, were laid out in straight streets crossing each other at right angles. II.  Present state of the ruins.", "A portion of the ruins is occupied by the modern town of  Hillah  . About five miles above Hillah, on the opposite or left bank of the Euphrates occurs a series of artificial mounds of enormous size. They consist chiefly of three great masses of building,", "the high pile of unbaked brickwork which is known to the Arabs as Babel, 600 feet square and 140 feet high; the building denominated the  Kasr  or palace, nearly 2000 feet square and 70 feet high, and a lofty mound upon which stands the modern tomb of  Amram-ibn-'Alb  . Scattered over the country on both sides of the Euphrates are a number of remarkable mounds, usually standing single, which are plainly of the same date with the great mass of ruins upon the river bank. Of these by far the most striking is the vast ruin called the  Birs-Nimrud  , which many regard as the tower of Babel, situated about six miles to the southwest of Hillah. [ BABEL, TOWER OF ] III.  Identification of sites.", "The great mound of Babel is probably the ancient temple of Beaus. The mound of the  Kasr  marks the site of the great palace of Nebuchadnezzar. The mound of  Amram  is thought to represent the \"hanging gardens\" of Nebuchadnezzar; but most probably it represents the ancient palace, coeval with Babylon itself, of which Nebuchadnezzar speaks in his inscriptions as adjoining his own more magnificent residence. IV.  History of Babylon.", "Scripture represents the \"beginning of the kingdom\" as belonging to the time of Nimrod. ( Genesis 10:6-10 ) The early annals of Babylon are filled by Berosus, the native historian, with three dynasties: one of 49 Chaldean kings, who reigned 458 years; another of 9 Arab kings, who reigned 245 years; and a third of 49 Assyrian monarchs, who held dominion for 526 years. The line of Babylonian kings becomes exactly known to us from B.C. 747. The \"Canon of Ptolemy\" gives us the succession of Babylonian monarchs from B.C. 747 to B.C. 331, when the last Persian king was dethroned by Alexander. On the fall of Nineveh, B.C. 625, Babylon became not only an independent kingdom, but an empire. The city was taken by surprise B.C. 539, as Jeremiah had prophesied, ( Jeremiah 51:31 ) by Cyrus, under Darius, Dan. 5, as intimated 170 years earlier by Isaiah, ( Isaiah 21:1-9 ) and, as Jeremiah had also foreshown, ( Jeremiah 51:39 ) during a festival. With the conquest of Cyrus commenced the decay of Babylon, which has since been a quarry from which all the tribes in the vicinity have derived the bricks with which they have built their cities. The \"great city\" has thus emphatically \"become heaps.\" ( Jeremiah 51:37 )  Ba'bel, Tower of.  The \"tower of Babel\" is only mentioned once in Scripture, ( Genesis 11:4,5 ) and then as incomplete. It was built of bricks, and the \"slime\" used for mortar was probably bitumen. Such authorities as we possess represent the building as destroyed soon after its erection. When the Jews, however, were carried captive into Babylonia, they thought they recognized it in the famous temple of Beaus, the modern  Birs Nimrod  . But the  Birs-Nimrrud  though it cannot be the tower of Babel itself; may well be taken to show the probable shape and character of the edifice. This building appears to have been a sort of oblique pyramid built in seven receding stages, each successive one being nearer to the southwestern end which constituted the back of the building. The first, second and third stories were each 26 feet high the remaining four being 15 feet high. On the seventh stage there was probably placed the ark or tabernacle, which seems to have been again 15 feet high, and must have nearly, if not entirely, covered the top of the seventh story The entire original height, allowing three feet for the platform, would thus have been 156 feet, or, without the plat-form, 163 feet."], "Word": "Babel", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "6": {"Definitions": ["BA'BEL ,  noun   [Heb.] Confusion; disorder."], "Word": "Babel", "Dictionary": "Webster's 1828 Dictionary"}, "7": {"Definitions": ["The name given to the tower which the primitive fathers of our race built in the land of Shinar after the Deluge ( Genesis 11:1-9) . Their object in building this tower was probably that it might be seen as a rallying-point in the extensive plain of Shinar, to which they had emigrated from the uplands of Armenia, and so prevent their being scattered abroad. But God interposed and defeated their design by condounding their language, and hence the name Babel, meaning \"confusion.\" In the Babylonian tablets there is an account of this event, and also of the creation and the deluge.

The first rise of the Chaldean power was in the region close upon the Persian Gulf; thence the nation spread northward up the course of the rivers, and the seat of government moved in the same direction, being finally fixed at Babylon, perhaps not earlier than B.C, 1700. I.  Topography of Babylon", "Ancient description of the city.", "All the ancient writers appear to agree in the fact of a district of vast size, more or less inhabited having been enclosed within lofty walls and included under the name of Babylon. With respect to the exact extent of the circuit they differ. The estimate of Herodotus and of Pliny is 480 stades (60 Roman miles, 53 of our miles) of Strabo 385, of Q. Curtius 368, of Clitarchus 365 and of Ctesias 360 stades (40 miles). (George Smith, in his \"Assyrian Discoveries,\" differs entirely from all these estimates, making the circuit of the city but  eight  miles.) Perhaps Herodotus spoke of the outer wall, which could be traced in his time. Taking the lowest estimate of the extent of the circuit, we shall have for the space within the rampart an area of above 100 square miles", "nearly five times the size of London! It is evident that this vast space cannot have been entirely covered with houses. The city was situated on both sides of the river Euphrates, and the two parts were connected together by a stone bridge five stades (above 1000 yards) long and 30 feet broad. At either extremity of the bridge was a royal palace, that in the eastern city being the more magnificent of the two. The two palaces were joined not only by the bridge, but by a tunnel under the river. The houses, which were frequently three or four stories high, were laid out in straight streets crossing each other at right angles. II.  Present state of the ruins.", "A portion of the ruins is occupied by the modern town of  Hillah  . About five miles above Hillah, on the opposite or left bank of the Euphrates occurs a series of artificial mounds of enormous size. They consist chiefly of three great masses of building,", "the high pile of unbaked brickwork which is known to the Arabs as Babel, 600 feet square and 140 feet high; the building denominated the  Kasr  or palace, nearly 2000 feet square and 70 feet high, and a lofty mound upon which stands the modern tomb of  Amram-ibn-'Alb  . Scattered over the country on both sides of the Euphrates are a number of remarkable mounds, usually standing single, which are plainly of the same date with the great mass of ruins upon the river bank. Of these by far the most striking is the vast ruin called the  Birs-Nimrud  , which many regard as the tower of Babel, situated about six miles to the southwest of Hillah. [ BABEL, TOWER OF ] III.  Identification of sites.", "The great mound of Babel is probably the ancient temple of Beaus. The mound of the  Kasr  marks the site of the great palace of Nebuchadnezzar. The mound of  Amram  is thought to represent the \"hanging gardens\" of Nebuchadnezzar; but most probably it represents the ancient palace, coeval with Babylon itself, of which Nebuchadnezzar speaks in his inscriptions as adjoining his own more magnificent residence. IV.  History of Babylon.", "Scripture represents the \"beginning of the kingdom\" as belonging to the time of Nimrod. ( Genesis 10:6-10 ) The early annals of Babylon are filled by Berosus, the native historian, with three dynasties: one of 49 Chaldean kings, who reigned 458 years; another of 9 Arab kings, who reigned 245 years; and a third of 49 Assyrian monarchs, who held dominion for 526 years. The line of Babylonian kings becomes exactly known to us from B.C. 747. The \"Canon of Ptolemy\" gives us the succession of Babylonian monarchs from B.C. 747 to B.C. 331, when the last Persian king was dethroned by Alexander. On the fall of Nineveh, B.C. 625, Babylon became not only an independent kingdom, but an empire. The city was taken by surprise B.C. 539, as Jeremiah had prophesied, ( Jeremiah 51:31 ) by Cyrus, under Darius, Dan. 5, as intimated 170 years earlier by Isaiah, ( Isaiah 21:1-9 ) and, as Jeremiah had also foreshown, ( Jeremiah 51:39 ) during a festival. With the conquest of Cyrus commenced the decay of Babylon, which has since been a quarry from which all the tribes in the vicinity have derived the bricks with which they have built their cities. The \"great city\" has thus emphatically \"become heaps.\" ( Jeremiah 51:37 )  Ba'bel, Tower of.  The \"tower of Babel\" is only mentioned once in Scripture, ( Genesis 11:4,5 ) and then as incomplete. It was built of bricks, and the \"slime\" used for mortar was probably bitumen. Such authorities as we possess represent the building as destroyed soon after its erection. When the Jews, however, were carried captive into Babylonia, they thought they recognized it in the famous temple of Beaus, the modern  Birs Nimrod  . But the  Birs-Nimrrud  though it cannot be the tower of Babel itself; may well be taken to show the probable shape and character of the edifice. This building appears to have been a sort of oblique pyramid built in seven receding stages, each successive one being nearer to the southwestern end which constituted the back of the building. The first, second and third stories were each 26 feet high the remaining four being 15 feet high. On the seventh stage there was probably placed the ark or tabernacle, which seems to have been again 15 feet high, and must have nearly, if not entirely, covered the top of the seventh story The entire original height, allowing three feet for the platform, would thus have been 156 feet, or, without the plat-form, 163 feet."], "Word": "Babel", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "6": {"Definitions": ["BA'BEL ,  noun   [Heb.] Confusion; disorder."], "Word": "Babel", "Dictionary": "Webster's 1828 Dictionary"}, "7": {"Definitions": ["The name given to the tower which the primitive fathers of our race built in the land of Shinar after the Deluge ( Genesis 11:1-9) .

But God interposed and defeated their design by condounding their language, and hence the name Babel, meaning \"confusion.\" In the Babylonian tablets there is an account of this event, and also of the creation and the deluge. (See  CHALDEA .)", "The Temple of Belus, which is supposed to occupy its site, is described by the Greek historian Herodotus as a temple of great extent and magnificence, erected by the Babylonians for their god Belus. The treasures Nebuchadnezzar brought from Jerusalem were laid up in this temple ( 2 Chronicles 36:7 ).", "The Birs Nimrud, at ancient Borsippa, about 7 miles south-west of Hillah, the modern town which occupies a part of the site of ancient Babylon, and 6 miles from the Euphrates, is an immense mass of broken and fire-blasted fragments, of about 2,300 feet in circumference, rising suddenly to the height of 235 feet above the desert-plain, and is with probability regarded as the ruins of the tower of Babel.
