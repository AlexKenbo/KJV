Even while the administration of Samuel gave something like a settled government to the south, there was scope for the irregular exploits of Samson on the borders of the Philistines; and Samuel at last established his authority as judge and prophet, but still as the servant of Jehovah, only to see it so abused by his sons as to exhaust the patience of the people, who at length demanded a  king  , after the pattern of the surrounding nations.

Under the name of \"Judeans\" the people of Isr'l were known to classical writers. (Tac. H. v.2, etc.) The force of the title \"Jew\" is seen particularly in the Gospel of St. John, who very rarely uses any other term to describe the opponents of our Lord. At an earlier stage of the progress of the faith it was contrasted with Greek as implying an outward covenant with God, ( Romans 1:16 ;  2:9,10 ;  Colossians 3:11 ) etc., which was the correlative of  Hellenist  [ HELLENIST ], and marked a division of language subsisting within the entire body, and at the same time less expressive than  Isr'lite  , which brought out with especial clearness the privileges and hopes of the children of Jacob.

The son of Amon, and his successor on the throne of Judah ( 2 Kings 22:1 ;  2 Chronicles 34:1 ). His history is contained in 2 Kings 22, 23. He stands foremost among all the kings of the line of David for unswerving loyalty to Jehovah ( 23:25 ). He \"did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked in all the way of David his father.\" He ascended the throne at the early age of eight years, and it appears that not till eight years afterwards did he begin \"to seek after the God of David his father.\" At that age he devoted himself to God. He distinguished himself by beginning a war of extermination against the prevailing idolatry, which had practically been the state religion for some seventy years ( 2 Chronicles 34:3 ; comp.  Jeremiah 25:3, 11, 29 ).", "In the eighteenth year of his reign he proceeded to repair and beautify the temple, which by time and violence had become sorely dilapidated ( 2 Kings 22:3, 5, 6 ;  23:23 ;  2 Chronicles 34:1 1).

She spoke to him words of encouragement, telling him that he would be gathered to his fathers in peace before the threatened days of judgment came. Josiah immediately gathered the people together, and engaged them in a renewal of their ancient national covenant with God. The Passover was then celebrated, as in the days of his great predecessor, Hezekiah, with unusual magnificence. Nevertheless, \"the Lord turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah\" ( 2 Kings 22:3-20 ;  23:21-27 ;  2 Chronicles 35:1-19 ).

(q.v.), king of Egypt, in an expedition against the king of Assyria, with the view of gaining possession of Carchemish, sought a passage through the territory of Judah for his army. This Josiah refused to permit. He had probably entered into some new alliance with the king of Assyria, and faithful to his word he sought to oppose the progress of Necho.", "The army of Judah went out and encountered that of Egypt at Megiddo, on the verge of the plain of Esdraelon.

His attendants conveyed him toward Jerusalem, but had only reached Hadadrimmon, a few miles south of Megiddo, when he died ( 2 Kings 23:28, 30 ; comp.  2 Chronicles 35:20-27 ), after a reign of thirty-one years. He was buried with the greatest honours in fulfilment of Huldah's prophecy ( 2 Kings 22:20 ; comp.  Jeremiah 34:5 ). Jeremiah composed a funeral elegy on this the best of the kings of Israel ( Lamentations 4:20 ;  2 Chronicles 35:25 ).

Escaping from the bloody battle of Ramoth-gilead, the prophet Jehu ( 2 Chronicles 19:1-3)  reproached him for the course he had been pursuing, whereupon he entered with rigour on his former course of opposition to all idolatry, and of deepening interest in the worship of God and in the righteous government of the people ( 2 Chronicles 19:4-11 ).", "Again he entered into an alliance with Ahaziah, the king of Israel, for the purpose of carrying on maritime commerce with Ophir. But the fleet that was then equipped at Ezion-gaber was speedily wrecked. A new fleet was fitted out without the co-operation of the king of Israel, and although it was successful, the trade was not prosecuted ( 2 Chronicles 20:35-37 ;  1 Kings 22:48-49 ).", "He subsequently joined Jehoram, king of Israel, in a war against the Moabites, who were under tribute to Israel. This war was successful. The Moabites were subdued; but the dreadful act of Mesha in offering his own son a sacrifice on the walls of Kir-haresheth in the sight of the armies of Israel filled him with horror, and he withdrew and returned to his own land ( 2 Kings 3:4-27 ).", "The last most notable event of his reign was that recorded in 2 Chronicles 20. The Moabites formed a great and powerful confederacy with the surrounding nations, and came against Jehoshaphat. The allied forces were encamped at Engedi. The king and his people were filled with alarm, and betook themselves to God in prayer. The king prayed in the court of the temple, \"O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us.\" Amid the silence that followed, the voice of Jahaziel the Levite was heard announcing that on the morrow all this great host would be overthrown. So it was, for they quarrelled among themselves, and slew one another, leaving to the people of Judah only to gather the rich spoils of the slain. This was recognized as a great deliverance wrought for them by God (B.C. 890). Soon after this Jehoshaphat died, after a reign of twenty-five years, being sixty years of age, and was succeeded by his son Jehoram ( 1 Kings 22:50 ). He had this testimony, that \"he sought the Lord with all his heart\" ( 2 Chronicles 22:9 ). The kingdom of Judah was never more prosperous than under his reign.", "6.

Athaliah was taken by surprise when she heard the shout of the people, \"Long live the king;\" and when she appeared in the temple, Jehoiada commanded her to be led forth to death ( 2 Kings 11:13-20 ). While the high priest lived, Jehoash favoured the worship of God and observed the law; but on his death he fell away into evil courses, and the land was defiled with idolatry. Zechariah, the son and successor of the high priest, was put to death. These evil deeds brought down on the land the judgement of God, and it was oppressed by the Syrian invaders. He is one of the three kings omitted by Matthew ( 1:8 ) in the genealogy of Christ, the other two being Ahaziah and Amaziah. He was buried in the city of David ( 2 Kings 12:21 ). (See  JOASH )", "2.

Hazael \"was cutting Israel short.\" He tolerated the worship of the golden calves, yet seems to have manifested a character of sincere devotion to the God of his fathers. He held the prophet Elisha in honour, and wept by his bedside when he was dying, addressing him in the words Elisha himself had used when Elijah was carried up into heaven- \"O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof.\" He was afterwards involved in war with Amaziah, the king of Judah ( 2 Chronicles 25:23-24 ), whom he utterly defeated at Beth-shemesh, on the borders of Dan and Philistia, and advancing on Jerusalem, broke down a portion of the wall, and carried away the treasures of the temple and the palace. He soon after died (B.C. 825), and was buried in Samaria ( 2 Kings 14:1-17, 19, 20 ). He was succeeded by his son.

King of Israel, the son of Jehoshaphat ( 2 Kings 9:2 ), and grandson of Nimshi. The story of his exaltation to the throne is deeply interesting. During the progress of a war against the Syrians, who were becoming more and more troublesome to Israel, in a battle at Ramoth-gilead Jehoram, the king of Israel, had been wounded; and leaving his army there, had returned to Jezreel, whither his ally, Ahaziah, king of Judah, had also gone on a visit of sympathy with him ( 2 Kings 8:28, 29 ). The commanders, being left in charge of the conduct of the war, met in council; and while engaged in their deliberations, a messenger from Elisha appeared in the camp, and taking Jehu from the council, led him into a secret chamber, and there anointed him king over Israel, and immediately retired and disappeared ( 2 Kings 9:5, 6 ). On being interrogated by his companions as to the object of this mysterious visitor, he informed them of what had been done, when immediately, with the utmost enthusiasm, they blew their trumpets and proclaimed him king ( 2 Kings 9:11-14 ). He then with a chosen band set forth with all speed to Jezreel, where, with his own hand, he slew Jehoram, shooting him through the heart with an arrow ( 9:24 ). The king of Judah, when trying to escape, was fatally wounded by one of Jehu's soldiers at Beth-gan. On entering the city, Jehu commanded the eunchs of the royal palace to cast down Jezebel into the street, where her mangled body was trodden under foot by the horses. Jehu was now master of Jezreel, whence he communicated with the persons in authority in Samaria the capital, commanding them to appear before him on the morrow with the heads of all the royal princes of Samaria. Accordingly on the morrow seventy heads were piled up in two heaps at his gate. At \"the shearing-house\" ( 2 Kings 10:12-14 ) other forty-two connected with the house of Ahab were put to death ( 2 Kings 10:14 ). As Jehu rode on toward Samaria, he met Jehonadab (q.v.), whom he took into his chariot, and they entered the capital together. By a cunning stratagem he cut off all the worshippers of Baal found in Samaria ( 2 Kings 10:19-25 ), and destroyed the temple of the idol ( 2 Kings 10:27 ).", "Notwithstanding all this apparent zeal for the worship of Jehovah, Jehu yet tolerated the worship of the golden calves at Dan and Bethel. For this the divine displeasure rested upon him, and his kingdom suffered disaster in war with the Syrians ( 2 Kings 10:29-33 ). He died after a reign of twenty-eight years (B.C. 884-856), and was buried in Samaria ( 10:34-36 ). \"He was one of those decisive, terrible, and ambitious, yet prudent, calculating, and passionless men whom God from time to time raises up to change the fate of empires and execute his judgments on the earth.\" He was the first Jewish king who came in contact with the Assyrian power in the time of Shalmaneser II."], "Word": "Jehu", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "2": {"Definitions": ["himself who exists"], "Word": "Jehu", "Dictionary": "Hitchcock's Names Dictionary"}, "3": {"Definitions": ["1.

The elder of the two sons of Jacob by Rachel ( Genesis 30:23, 24 ), who, on the occasion of his birth, said, \"God hath taken away [Heb. asaph] my reproach.\" \"The Lord shall add [Heb. yoseph] to me another son\" ( Genesis 30:24 ). He was a child of probably six years of age when his father returned from Haran to Canaan and took up his residence in the old patriarchal town of Hebron. \"Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age,\" and he \"made him a long garment with sleeves\" ( Genesis 37:3 , R.V. marg.), i.e., a garment long and full, such as was worn by the children of nobles. This seems to be the correct rendering of the words. The phrase, however, may also be rendered, \"a coat of many pieces\", i.e., a patchwork of many small pieces of divers colours.", "When he was about seventeen years old Joseph incurred the jealous hatred of his brothers ( Genesis 37:4 ). They \"hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.\" Their anger was increased when he told them his dreams ( 37:11 ).", "Jacob desiring to hear tidings of his sons, who had gone to Shechem with their flocks, some 60 miles from Hebron, sent Joseph as his messenger to make inquiry regarding them. Joseph found that they had left Shechem for Dothan, whither he followed them. As soon as they saw him coming they began to plot against him, and would have killed him had not Reuben interposed. They ultimately sold him to a company of Ishmaelite merchants for twenty pieces (shekels) of silver (about $2, 10s.), ten pieces less than the current value of a slave, for \"they cared little what they had for him, if so be they were rid of him.\" These merchants were going down with a varied assortment of merchandise to the Egyptian market, and thither they conveyed him, and ultimately sold him as a slave to Potiphar, an \"officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard\" ( Genesis 37:3 6). \"The Lord blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake,\" and Potiphar made him overseer over his house. At length a false charge having been brought against him by Potiphar's wife, he was at once cast into the state prison (39; 40), where he remained for at least two years. After a while the \"chief of the cupbearers\" and the \"chief of the bakers\" of Pharaoh's household were cast into the same prison ( 40:2 ). Each of these new prisoners dreamed a dream in the same night, which Joseph interpreted, the event occurring as he had said.", "This led to Joseph's being remembered subsequently by the chief butler when Pharaoh also dreamed. At his suggestion Joseph was brought from prison to interpret the king's dreams. Pharaoh was well pleased with Joseph's wisdom in interpreting his dreams, and with his counsel with reference to the events then predicted; and he set him over all the land of Egypt ( Genesis 41:46 ), and gave him the name of Zaphnath-paaneah. He was married to Asenath, the daughter of the priest of On, and thus became a member of the priestly class. Joseph was now about thirty years of age.", "As Joseph had interpreted, seven years of plenty came, during which he stored up great abundance of corn in granaries built for the purpose. These years were followed by seven years of famine \"over all the face of the earth,\" when \"all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy corn\" ( Genesis 41:56, 57 ;  47:13, 14 ). Thus \"Joseph gathered up all the money that was in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought.\" Afterwards all the cattle and all the land, and at last the Egyptians themselves, became the property of Pharaoh.", "During this period of famine Joseph's brethren also came down to Egypt to buy corn. The history of his dealings with them, and of the manner in which he at length made himself known to them, is one of the most interesting narratives that can be read (Genesis 42-45). Joseph directed his brethren to return and bring Jacob and his family to the land of Egypt, saying, \"I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land. Regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land is yours.\" Accordingly Jacob and his family, to the number of threescore and ten souls, together with \"all that they had,\" went down to Egypt. They were settled in the land of Goshen, where Joseph met his father, and \"fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while\" ( Genesis 46:29 ).", "The excavations of Dr. Naville have shown the land of Goshen to be the Wady Tumilat, between Ismailia and Zagazig. In Goshen (Egyptian Qosem) they had pasture for their flocks, were near the Asiatic frontier of Egypt, and were out of the way of the Egyptian people. An inscription speaks of it as a district given up to the wandering shepherds of Asia.", "Jacob at length died, and in fulfilment of a promise which he had exacted, Joseph went up to Canaan to bury his father in \"the field of Ephron the Hittite\" ( Genesis 47:29-31 ;  50:1-14 ). This was the last recorded act of Joseph, who again returned to Egypt.", "\"The Story of the Two Brothers,' an Egyptian romance written for the son of the Pharaoh of the Oppression, contains an episode very similar to the Biblical account of Joseph's treatment by Potiphar's wife. Potiphar and Potipherah are the Egyptian Pa-tu-pa-Ra, the gift of the sun-god.' The name given to Joseph, Zaphnath-paaneah, is probably the Egyptian Zaf-nti-pa-ankh, nourisher of the living one,' i.e., of the Pharaoh. There are many instances in the inscriptions of foreigners in Egypt receiving Egyptian names, and rising to the highest offices of state.\"", "By his wife Asenath, Joseph had two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim ( Genesis 41:50 ). Joseph having obtained a promise from his brethren that when the time should come that God would \"bring them unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob,\" they would carry up his bones out of Egypt, at length died, at the age of one hundred and ten years; and \"they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin\" ( Genesis 50:26 ). This promise was faithfully observed. Their descendants, long after, when the Exodus came, carried the body about with them during their forty years' wanderings, and at length buried it in Shechem, in the parcel of ground which Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor ( Joshua 24:32 ; comp.  Genesis 33:19 ). With the death of Joseph the patriarchal age of the history of Israel came to a close.", "The Pharaoh of Joseph's elevation was probably Apepi, or Apopis, the last of the Hyksos kings. Some, however, think that Joseph came to Egypt in the reign of Thothmes III. (see  PHARAOH ), long after the expulsion of the Hyksos.", "The name Joseph denotes the two tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh in  Deuteronomy 33:13-17 ; the kingdom of Israel in  Ezekiel 37:16, 19 ,  Amos 5:6 ; and the whole covenant people of Israel in  Psalms 81:4 .", "2.

He is called a \"just man.\" He was by trade a carpenter ( Matthew 13:55 ). He is last mentioned in connection with the journey to Jerusalem, when Jesus was twelve years old. It is probable that he died before Jesus entered on his public ministry. This is concluded from the fact that Mary only was present at the marriage feast in Cana of Galilee. His name does not appear in connection with the scenes of the crucifixion along with that of Mary (q.v.),  John 19:25 .", "5.  A native of Arimathea, probably the Ramah of the Old Testament ( 1 Samuel 1:19 ), a man of wealth, and a member of the Sanhedrim ( Matthew 27:57 ;  Luke 23:50 ), an \"honourable counsellor, who waited for the kingdom of God.\" As soon as he heard the tidings of Christ's death, he \"went in boldly\" (lit. \"having summoned courage, he went\") \"unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.\" Pilate having ascertained from the centurion that the death had really taken place, granted Joseph's request, who immediately, having purchased fine linen ( Mark 15:46 ), proceeded to Golgotha to take the body down from the cross. There, assisted by Nicodemus, he took down the body and wrapped it in the fine linen, sprinkling it with the myrrh and aloes which Nicodemus had brought ( John 19:39 ), and then conveyed the body to the new tomb hewn by Joseph himself out of a rock in his garden hard by. There they laid it, in the presence of Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of Joses, and other women, and rolled a great stone to the entrance, and departed ( Luke 23:53, 55 ). This was done in haste, \"for the Sabbath was drawing on\" (comp.  Isaiah 53:9 ).", "6.  Surnamed Barsabas ( Acts 1:23 ); also called Justus.

He became Moses' minister or servant, and accompanied him part of the way when he ascended Mount Sinai to receive the two tables ( Exodus 32:17 ). He was also one of the twelve who were sent on by Moses to explore the land of Canaan ( Numbers 13:16, 17 ), and only he and Caleb gave an encouraging report. Under the direction of God, Moses, before his death, invested Joshua in a public and solemn manner with authority over the people as his successor ( Deuteronomy 31:23 ). The people were encamped at Shittim when he assumed the command ( Joshua 1:1 ); and crossing the Jordan, they encamped at Gilgal, where, having circumcised the people, he kept the Passover, and was visited by the Captain of the Lord's host, who spoke to him encouraging words ( 1:1-9 ).", "Now began the wars of conquest which Joshua carried on for many years, the record of which is in the book which bears his name. Six nations and thirty-one kings were conquered by him ( Joshua 11:18-23 ;  12:24 ).

(See  SHILOH ;  PRIEST .)", "His work being done, he died, at the age of one hundred and ten years, twenty-five years after having crossed the Jordan.

It was no doubt on that occasion that his name was changed from Oshea, help,' to Jehoshua, Jehovah is help' ( Numbers 13:16 ). And this name is the key to his life and work. Alike in bringing the people into Canaan, in his wars, and in the distribution of the land among the tribes, from the miraculous crossing of Jordan and taking of Jericho to his last address, he was the embodiment of his new name, Jehovah is help.' To this outward calling his character also corresponded.

There is every reason for concluding that the uniform tradition of the Jews is correct when they assign the authorship of the book to Joshua, all except the concluding section; the last verses ( 24:29-33 ) were added by some other hand.", "There are two difficulties connected with this book which have given rise to much discussion,", "1.  The miracle of the standing still of the sun and moon on Gibeon. The record of it occurs in Joshua's impassioned prayer of faith, as quoted ( Joshua 10:12-15 ) from the \"Book of Jasher\" (q.v.). There are many explanations given of these words. They need, however, present no difficulty if we believe in the possibility of God's miraculous interposition in behalf of his people. Whether it was caused by the refraction of the light, or how, we know not.", "2.  Another difficulty arises out of the command given by God utterly to exterminate the Canaanites. \"Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\" It is enough that Joshua clearly knew that this was the will of God, who employs his terrible agencies, famine, pestilence, and war, in the righteous government of this world. The Canaanites had sunk into a state of immorality and corruption so foul and degrading that they had to be rooted out of the land with the edge of the sword. \"The Israelites' sword, in its bloodiest executions, wrought a work of mercy for all the countries of the earth to the very end of the world.\"", "This book resembles the Acts of the Apostles in the number and variety of historical incidents it records, and in its many references to persons and places; and as in the latter case the epistles of Paul (see Paley's Horae Paul.) confirm its historical accuracy by their incidental allusions and \"undesigned coincidences,\" so in the former modern discoveries confirm its historicity. The Amarna tablets (see  ADONIZEDEC ) are among the most remarkable discoveries of the age. Dating from about B.C. 1480 down to the time of Joshua, and consisting of official communications from Amorite, Phoenician, and Philistine chiefs to the king of Egypt, they afford a glimpse into the actual condition of Palestine prior to the Hebrew invasion, and illustrate and confirm the history of the conquest. A letter, also still extant, from a military officer, \"master of the captains of Egypt,\" dating from near the end of the reign of Rameses II., gives a curious account of a journey, probably official, which he undertook through Palestine as far north as to Aleppo, and an insight into the social condition of the country at that time. Among the things brought to light by this letter and the Amarna tablets is the state of confusion and decay that had now fallen on Egypt. The Egyptian garrisons that had held possession of Palestine from the time of Thothmes III., some two hundred years before, had now been withdrawn. The way was thus opened for the Hebrews. In the history of the conquest there is no mention of Joshua having encountered any Egyptian force. The tablets contain many appeals to the king of Egypt for help against the inroads of the Hebrews, but no help seems ever to have been sent. Is not this just such a state of things as might have been anticipated as the result of the disaster of the Exodus? In many points, as shown under various articles, the progress of the conquest is remarkably illustrated by the tablets. The value of modern discoveries in their relation to Old Testament history has been thus well described-", "\"The difficulty of establishing the charge of lack of historical credibility, as against the testimony of the Old Testament, has of late years greatly increased. The outcome of recent excavations and explorations is altogether against it. As long as these books contained, in the main, the only known accounts of the events they mention, there was some plausibility in the theory that perhaps these accounts were written rather to teach moral lessons than to preserve an exact knowledge of events. It was easy to say in those times men had not the historic sense. But the recent discoveries touch the events recorded in the Bible at very many different points in many different generations, mentioning the same persons, countries, peoples, events that are mentioned in the Bible, and showing beyond question that these were strictly historic. The point is not that the discoveries confirm the correctness of the Biblical statements, though that is commonly the case, but that the discoveries show that the peoples of those ages had the historic sense, and, specifically, that the Biblical narratives they touch are narratives of actual occurrences.\""], "Word": "Joshua, the Book of", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}}}

Abner slew in battle Asahel, the youngest brother of Joab; and when David afterward received Abner into favor, Joab treacherously murdered him. [ ABNER ] There was now no rival left in the way of Joab's advancement, and at the siege of Jebus he was appointed for his prowess commander-in-chief", "\"captain of the host.\" In the wide range of wars which David undertook, Joab was the acting general. He was called by the almost regal title of \"lord,\" ( 2 Samuel 11:11 ) \"the prince of the king's army.\" ( 1 Chronicles 27:34 ) In the entangled relations which grew up in David's domestic life he bore an important part, successfully reinstating Absalom in David's favor after the murder of Amnon. ( 2 Samuel 14:1-20 ) When the relations between father and son were reversed by the revolt of Absalom, Joab remained true to the king, taking the rebel prince's dangerous life in spite of David's injunction to spare him, and when no one else had courage to act so decisive a part. ( 2 Samuel 18:2,11-15 ) (B.C. 1023). The king transferred the command to Amasa, which so enraged Joab that he adroitly assassinated Amasa when pretending to welcome him as a friend. ( 2 Samuel 20:10 ) Friendly relations between himself and David seem to have existed afterward, ( 2 Samuel 24:2 ) but at the close of his long life, his loyalty, so long unshaken, at last wavered. \"Though he had not turned after Absalom, he turned after Adonijah.\" ( 1 Kings 2:28 ) This probably filled up the measure of the king's long-cherished resentment. The revival of the pretensions of Adonijah after David's death was sufficient to awaken the suspicions of Solomon. Joab fled to the shelter of the altar at Gibeon, and was here slain by Benaiah.

( 2 Kings 14:25 ) He flourished in or before the reign of Jeroboam II., about B.C. 820. Having already, as it seems, prophesied to Isr'l, he was sent to Nineveh. The time was one of political revival in Isr'l; but ere long the Assyrians were to be employed by God as a scourge upon them. The prophet shrank from a commission which he felt sure would result, ( Jonah 4:2 ) in the sparing of a hostile city. He attempted therefore to escape to Tarshish. The providence of God, however, watched over him, first in a storm, and then in his being swallowed by a large fish (a sea monster, probably the white shark) for the space of three days and three nights. [On this subject see article WHALE] After his deliverance, Jonah executed his commission; and the king, \"believing him to be a minister form the supreme deity of the nation,\" and having heard of his miraculous deliverance, ordered a general fast, and averted the threatened judgment. But the prophet, not from personal but national feelings, grudged the mercy shown to a heathen nation. He was therefore taught by the significant lesson of the \"gourd,\" whose growth and decay brought the truth at once home to him, that he was sent to testify by deed, as other prophets would afterward testify by word, the capacity of Gentiles for salvation, and the design of God to make them partakers of it. This was \"the sign of the prophet Jonas.\" ( Luke 11:29,30 ) But the resurrection of Christ itself was also shadowed forth in the history of the prophet. ( Matthew 12:39,41 ;  16:4 ) The mission of Jonah was highly symbolical. The facts contained a concealed prophecy.

It gives an account of (1) his divine commission to go to Nineveh, his disobedience, and the punishment following ( 1:1-17 ); (2) his prayer and miraculous deliverance ( 1:17-2:10 ); (3) the second commission given to him, and his prompt obedience in delivering the message from God, and its results in the repentance of the Ninevites, and God's long-sparing mercy toward them (ch. 3); (4) Jonah's displeasure at God's merciful decision, and the rebuke tendered to the impatient prophet (ch. 4).

of Isaac by Rebekah. He was born probably at Lahai-roi, when his father was fifty-nine and Abraham one hundred and fifty-nine years old. Like his father, he was of a quiet and gentle disposition, and when he grew up followed the life of a shepherd, while his brother Esau became an enterprising hunter. His dealing with Esau, however, showed much mean selfishness and cunning ( Genesis 25:29-34 ).", "When Isaac was about 160 years of age, Jacob and his mother conspired to deceive the aged patriarch (Genesis 27), with the view of procuring the transfer of the birthright to himself. The birthright secured to him who possessed it (1) superior rank in his family ( Genesis 49:3 ); (2) a double portion of the paternal inheritance ( Deuteronomy 21:17 ); (3) the priestly office in the family ( Numbers 8:17-19 ); and (4) the promise of the Seed in which all nations of the earth were to be blessed ( Genesis 22:18 ).", "Soon after his acquisition of his father's blessing (Genesis 27), Jacob became conscious of his guilt; and afraid of the anger of Esau, at the suggestion of Rebekah Isaac sent him away to Haran, 400 miles or more, to find a wife among his cousins, the family of Laban, the Syrian (28). There he met with Rachel (29). Laban would not consent to give him his daughter in marriage till he had served seven years; but to Jacob these years \"seemed but a few days, for the love he had to her.\" But when the seven years were expired, Laban craftily deceived Jacob, and gave him his daughter Leah. Other seven years of service had to be completed probably before he obtained the beloved Rachel. But \"life-long sorrow, disgrace, and trials, in the retributive providence of God, followed as a consequence of this double union.\"", "At the close of the fourteen years of service, Jacob desired to return to his parents, but at the entreaty of Laban he tarried yet six years with him, tending his flocks ( 31:41 ). He then set out with his family and property \"to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan\" (Genesis 31). Laban was angry when he heard that Jacob had set out on his journey, and pursued after him, overtaking him in seven days. The meeting was of a painful kind. After much recrimination and reproach directed against Jacob, Laban is at length pacified, and taking an affectionate farewell of his daughters, returns to his home in Padanaram. And now all connection of the Israelites with Mesopotamia is at an end.", "Soon after parting with Laban he is met by a company of angels, as if to greet him on his return and welcome him back to the Land of Promise ( 32:1, 2 ). He called the name of the place Mahanaim, i.e., \"the double camp,\" probably his own camp and that of the angels. The vision of angels was the counterpart of that he had formerly seen at Bethel, when, twenty years before, the weary, solitary traveller, on his way to Padan-aram, saw the angels of God ascending and descending on the ladder whose top reached to heaven ( 28:12 ).", "He now hears with dismay of the approach of his brother Esau with a band of 400 men to meet him. In great agony of mind he prepares for the worst. He feels that he must now depend only on God, and he betakes himself to him in earnest prayer, and sends on before him a munificent present to Esau, \"a present to my lord Esau from thy servant Jacob.\" Jacob's family were then transported across the Jabbok; but he himself remained behind, spending the night in communion with God. While thus engaged, there appeared one in the form of a man who wrestled with him. In this mysterious contest Jacob prevailed, and as a memorial of it his name was changed to Israel (wrestler with God); and the place where this occured he called Peniel, \"for\", said he, \"I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved\" ( 32:25-31 ).", "After this anxious night, Jacob went on his way, halting, mysteriously weakened by the conflict, but strong in the assurance of the divine favour. Esau came forth and met him; but his spirit of revenge was appeased, and the brothers met as friends, and during the remainder of their lives they maintained friendly relations. After a brief sojourn at Succoth, Jacob moved forward and pitched his tent near Shechem (q.v.),  33:18 ; but at length, under divine directions, he moved to Bethel, where he made an altar unto God ( 35:6, 7 ), and where God appeared to him and renewed the Abrahamic covenant. While journeying from Bethel to Ephrath (the Canaanitish name of Bethlehem), Rachel died in giving birth to her second son Benjamin ( 35:16-20 ), fifteen or sixteen years after the birth of Joseph. He then reached the old family residence at Mamre, to wait on the dying bed of his father Isaac. The complete reconciliation between Esau and Jacob was shown by their uniting in the burial of the patriarch ( 35:27-29 ).", "Jacob was soon after this deeply grieved by the loss of his beloved son Joseph through the jealousy of his brothers ( 37:33 ). Then follows the story of the famine, and the successive goings down into Egypt to buy corn (42), which led to the discovery of the long-lost Joseph, and the patriarch's going down with all his household, numbering about seventy souls ( Exodus 1:5 ;  Deuteronomy 10:22 ;  Acts 7:14 ), to sojourn in the land of Goshen. Here Jacob, \"after being strangely tossed about on a very rough ocean, found at last a tranquil harbour, where all the best affections of his nature were gently exercised and largely unfolded\" ( Genesis 48 ). At length the end of his checkered course draws nigh, and he summons his sons to his bedside that he may bless them. Among his last words he repeats the story of Rachel's death, although forty years had passed away since that event took place, as tenderly as if it had happened only yesterday; and when \"he had made an end of charging his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost\" ( 49:33 ). His body was embalmed and carried with great pomp into the land of Canaan, and buried beside his wife Leah in the cave of Machpelah, according to his dying charge. There, probably, his embalmed body remains to this day ( 50:1-13 ). (See  HEBRON .)", "The history of Jacob is referred to by the prophets Hosea ( 12:3, 4, 12 ) and Malachi ( 1:2 ).

He was born with Esau, probably at the well of Lahai-roi, about B.C. 1837. His history is related in the latter half of the book of Genesis. He bought the birthright from his brother Esau, and afterward acquired the blessing intended for Esau, by practicing a well-known deceit on Isaac. (Jacob did not obtain the blessing because of his deceit, but in spite of it. That which was promised he would have received in some good way; but Jacob and his mother, distrusting God's promise, sought the promised blessing in a wrong way, and received with it trouble and sorrow.", "ED.) Jacob, in his 78th year, was sent from the family home to avoid his brother, and to seek a wife among his kindred in Padan-aram. As he passed through Bethel, God appeared to him. After the lapse of twenty-one years he returned from Padan-aram with two wives, two concubines, eleven sons and a daughter, and large property. He escaped from the angry pursuit of Laban, from a meeting with Esau, and from the vengeance of the Canaanites provoked by the murder of Shechem; and in each of these three emergencies he was aided and strengthened by the interposition of God, and in sign of the grace won by a night of wrestling with God his name was changed at Jabbok into Isr'l. Deborah and Rachel died before he reached Hebron; Joseph, the favorite son of Jacob, was sold into Egypt eleven years before the death of Isaac; and Jacob had probably exceeded his 130th year when he went tither. He was presented to Pharaoh, and dwelt for seventeen years in Rameses and Goshen, and died in his 147th year. His body was embalmed, carried with great care and pomp into the land of Canaan, and deposited with his fathers, and his wife Leah, in the cave of Machpelah.

Vowing his vow unto God, ( Judges 11:31 ) that he would offer up as a burn offering whatsoever should come out to meet him if successful, he went forth to battle. The Ammonites were routed with great slaughter; but as the conqueror returned to Mizpeh there came out to meet him his daughter, his only child, with timbrels and dancing. The father is heart-stricken; but the maiden asks only for a respite of two months in which to prepare for death. When that time was ended she returned to her father, who \"did with her according to his vow.\" The tribe of Ephraim challenged Jephthah's right to go to war as he had done, without their concurrence, against Ammon. He first defeated them, then intercepted the fugitives at the fords of Jordan, and there put forty-two thousand men to the sword. He judged Isr'l six years, and died. It is generally conjectured that his jurisdiction was limited to the transjordanic region. That the daughter of Jephthah was really offered up to God in sacrifice is a conclusion which it seems impossible to avoid. (But there is no word of approval, as if such a sacrifice was acceptable to God. Josephus well says that \"the sacrifice was neither sanctioned by the Mosaic ritual nor acceptable to God.\" The vow and the fulfillment were the mistaken conceptions of a rude chieftain, not acts pleasing to God.", "ED.)"], "Word": "Jephthah", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "4": {"Definitions": ["( Judges 11:30, 31 ). After a crushing defeat of the Ammonites, Jephthah returned to his own house, and the first to welcome him was his own daughter. This was a terrible blow to the victor, and in his despair he cried out, \"Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low...I have opened my mouth unto the Lord, and cannot go back.\" With singular nobleness of spirit she answered, \"Do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth.\" She only asked two months to bewail her maidenhood with her companions upon the mountains. She utters no reproach against her father's rashness, and is content to yield her life since her father has returned a conqueror. But was it so? Did Jephthah offer up his daughter as a \"burnt-offering\"? This question has been much debated, and there are many able commentators who argue that such a sacrifice was actually offered. We are constrained, however, by a consideration of Jephthah's known piety as a true worshipper of Jehovah, his evident acquaintance with the law of Moses, to which such sacrifices were abhorrent ( Leviticus 18:21 ;  20:2-5 ;  Deuteronomy 12:31 ), and the place he holds in the roll of the heroes of the faith in the Epistle to the Hebrews ( 11:32 ), to conclude that she was only doomed to a life of perpetual celibacy."], "Word": "Jephthah's Vow", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}}}

It is important to notice that modern ethnological science, reasoning from a careful analysis of facts, has arrived at the conclusion that there is a three-fold division of the human family, corresponding in a remarkable way with the great ethnological chapter of the book of Genesis (10). The three great races thus distinguished are called the Semitic, Aryan, and Turanian (Allophylian). \"Setting aside the cases where the ethnic names employed are of doubtful application, it cannot reasonably be questioned that the author [of Genesis 10] has in his account of the sons of Japheth classed together the Cymry or Celts (Gomer), the Medes (Madai), and the Ionians or Greeks (Javan), thereby anticipating what has become known in modern times as the Indo-European Theory,' or the essential unity of the Aryan (Asiatic) race with the principal races of Europe, indicated by the Celts and the Ionians. Nor can it be doubted that he has thrown together under the one head of 'children of Shem' the Assyrians (Asshur), the Syrians (Aram), the Hebrews (Eber), and the Joktanian Arabs (Joktan), four of the principal races which modern ethnology recognizes under the heading of Semitic.' Again, under the heading of sons of Ham,' the author has arranged Cush', i.e., the Ethiopians; Mizraim,' the people of Egypt; Sheba and Dedan,' or certain of the Southern Arabs; and Nimrod,' or the ancient people of Babylon, four races between which the latest linguistic researches have established a close affinity\" (Rawlinson's Hist.

Two sources are generally spoken of.", "1.  From the western base of a hill on which once stood the city of Dan, the northern border-city of Palestine, there gushes forth a considerable fountain called the Leddan, which is the largest fountain in Syria and the principal source of the Jordan.", "2.  Beside the ruins of Banias, the ancient Caesarea Philippi and the yet more ancient Panium, is a lofty cliff of limestone, at the base of which is a fountain. This is the other source of the Jordan, and has always been regarded by the Jews as its true source. It rushes down to the plain in a foaming torrent, and joins the Leddan about 5 miles south of Dan (Tell-el-Kady).", "3.  But besides these two historical fountains there is a third, called the Hasbany, which rises in the bottom of a valley at the western base of Hermon, 12 miles north of Tell-el-Kady. It joins the main stream about a mile below the junction of the Leddan and the Banias. The river thus formed is at this point about 45 feet wide, and flows in a channel from 12 to 20 feet below the plain. After this it flows, \"with a swift current and a much-twisted course,\" through a marshy plain for some 6 miles, when it falls into the Lake Huleh, \"the waters of Merom\" (q.v.).", "During this part of its course the Jordan has descended about 1,100 feet. At Banias it is 1,080 feet above sea-level. Flowing from the southern extremity of Lake Huleh, here almost on a level with the sea, it flows for 2 miles \"through a waste of islets and papyrus,\" and then for 9 miles through a narrow gorge in a foaming torrent onward to the Sea of Galilee (q.v.).", "\"In the whole valley of the Jordan from the Lake Huleh to the Sea of Galilee there is not a single settled inhabitant. Along the whole eastern bank of the river and the lakes, from the base of Hermon to the ravine of Hieromax, a region of great fertility, 30 miles long by 7 or 8 wide, there are only some three inhabited villages. The western bank is almost as desolate. Ruins are numerous enough. Every mile or two is an old site of town or village, now well nigh hid beneath a dense jungle of thorns and thistles. The words of Scripture here recur to us with peculiar force- I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation...And I will bring the land into desolation- and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it...And your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste. Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate' ( Leviticus 26:31-34 ).\", Dr. Porter's Handbook.", "From the Sea of Galilee, at the level of 682 feet below the Mediterranean, the river flows through a long, low plain called \"the region of Jordan\" ( Matthew 3:5 ), and by the modern Arabs the Ghor, or \"sunken plain.\" This section is properly the Jordan of Scripture. Down through the midst of the \"plain of Jordan\" there winds a ravine varying in breadth from 200 yards to half a mile, and in depth from 40 to 150 feet. Through it the Jordan flows in a rapid, rugged, tortuous course down to the Dead Sea. The whole distance from the southern extremity of the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea is in a straight line about 65 miles, but following the windings of the river about 200 miles, during which it falls 618 feet.

It is the river of the \"great plain\" of Palestine", "the \"descender,\" if not \"the river of God\" in the book of Psalms, at least that of his chosen people throughout their history. There were fords over against Jericho, to which point the men of Jericho pursued the spies. ( Joshua 2:7 ) comp.  Judges 3:28  Higher up where the fords or passages of Bethbarah, where Gideon lay in wait for the Midianites, ( Judges 7:24 ) and where the men of Gilead slew the Ephraimites. ch. ( Judges 12:6 ) These fords undoubtedly witnessed the first recorded passage of the Jordan in the Old Testament. ( Genesis 32:10 ) Jordan was next crossed, over against Jericho, by Joshua. ( Joshua 4:12,13 ) From their vicinity to Jerusalem the lower fords were much used. David, it is probable, passed over them in one instance to fight the Syrians. ( 2 Samuel 10:17 ;  17:22 ) Thus there were two customary places at which the Jordan was fordable; and it must have been at one of these, if not at both, that baptism was afterward administered by St. John and by the disciples of our Lord. Where our Lord was baptized is not stated expressly, but it was probably at the upper ford. These fords were rendered so much more precious in those days from two circumstances. First, it does not appear that there were then any bridges thrown over or boats regularly established on the Jordan; and secondly, because \"Jordan overflowed all his banks all the time of harvest.\" ( Joshua 3:15 ) The channel or bed of the river became brimful, so that the level of the water and of the banks was then the same. (Dr. Selah Merrill, in his book \"Galilee in the Time of Christ\" (1881), says, \"Near Tarich'a, just below the point where the Jordan leaves the lake (of Galilee), there was (in Christ's time) a splendid bridge across the river, supported by ten piers.\"", "ED.) The last feature which remains to be noticed in the scriptural account of the Jordan is its frequent mention as a boundary- \"over Jordan,\" \"this\" and \"the other side,\" or \"beyond Jordan,\" were expressions as familiar to the Isr'lites as \"across the water,\" \"this\" and \"the other side of the Channel\" are to English ears. In one sense indeed, that is, in so far as it was the eastern boundary of the land of Canaan, it was the eastern boundary of the promised land. ( Numbers 34:12 ) The Jordan rises from several sources near Panium ( Banias ), and passes through the lakes of Merom ( Huleh ) and Gennesaret. The two principal features in its course are its descent and its windings. From its fountain heads to the Dead Sea it rushes down one continuous inclined plane, only broken by a series of rapids or precipitous falls. Between the Lake of Gennesaret and the Dead Sea there are 27 rapids. The depression of the Lake of Gennesaret below the level of the Mediterranean is 653 feet, and that of the Dead Sea 1316 feet. (The whole descent from its source to the Dead Sea is 3000 feet. Its width varies form 45 to 180 feet, and it is from 3 to 12 feet deep. -Schaff.) Its sinuosity is not so remarkable in the upper part of its course. The only tributaries to the Jordan below Gennesaret are the  Yarmuk  (Hieromax) and the  Zerka  (Jabbok).

He was the son of a widow of Zereda, and while still young was promoted by Solomon to be chief superintendent of the \"burnden\", i.e., of the bands of forced labourers. Influenced by the words of the prophet Ahijah, he began to form conspiracies with the view of becoming king of the ten tribes; but these having been discovered, he fled to Egypt ( 1 Kings 11:29-40 ), where he remained for a length of time under the protection of Shishak I. On the death of Solomon, the ten tribes, having revolted, sent to invite him to become their king. The conduct of Rehoboam favoured the designs of Jeroboam, and he was accordingly proclaimed \"king of Israel\" ( 1 Kings 12:1-20 ). He rebuilt and fortified Shechem as the capital of his kingdom. He at once adopted means to perpetuate the division thus made between the two parts of the kingdom, and erected at Dan and Bethel, the two extremities of his kingdom, \"golden calves,\" which he set up as symbols of Jehovah, enjoining the people not any more to go up to worship at Jerusalem, but to bring their offerings to the shrines he had erected. Thus he became distinguished as the man \"who made Israel to sin.\" This policy was followed by all the succeeding kings of Israel.", "While he was engaged in offering incense at Bethel, a prophet from Judah appeared before him with a warning message from the Lord. Attempting to arrest the prophet for his bold words of defiance, his hand was \"dried up,\" and the altar before which he stood was rent asunder. At his urgent entreaty his \"hand was restored him again\" ( 1 Kings 13:1-6, 9 ; comp.  2 Kings 23:15 ); but the miracle made no abiding impression on him.

His reign was contemporary with those of Amaziah ( 2 Kings 14:23 ) and Uzziah ( 15:1 ), kings of Judah. He was victorious over the Syrians ( 13:4 ;  14:26, 27 ), and extended Israel to its former limits, from \"the entering of Hamath to the sea of the plain\" ( 14:25 ;  Amos 6:14 ). His reign of forty-one years was the most prosperous that Israel had ever known as yet. With all this outward prosperity, however, iniquity widely prevailed in the land ( Amos 2:6-8;   4:1 ;  6:6 ;  Hosea 4:12-14 ).

This name is in the original in the dual form, and means \"possession of peace,\" or \"foundation of peace.\" The dual form probably refers to the two mountains on which it was built, viz., Zion and Moriah; or, as some suppose, to the two parts of the city, the \"upper\" and the \"lower city.\" Jerusalem is a \"mountain city enthroned on a mountain fastness\" (comp.  Psalms 68:15, 16 ;  87:1 ;  125:2 ;  76:1, 2 ;  122:3 ). It stands on the edge of one of the highest table-lands in Palestine, and is surrounded on the south-eastern, the southern, and the western sides by deep and precipitous ravines.", "It is first mentioned in Scripture under the name Salem ( Genesis 14:18 ; comp.  Psalms 76:2 ). When first mentioned under the name Jerusalem, Adonizedek was its king ( Joshua 10:1 ). It is afterwards named among the cities of Benjamin ( Judges 19:10 ;  1 Chronicles 11:4 ); but in the time of David it was divided between Benjamin and Judah. After the death of Joshua the city was taken and set on fire by the men of Judah ( Judges 1:1-8) ; but the Jebusites were not wholly driven out of it. The city is not again mentioned till we are told that David brought the head of Goliath thither ( 1 Samuel 17:54 ). David afterwards led his forces against the Jebusites still residing within its walls, and drove them out, fixing his own dwelling on Zion, which he called \"the city of David\" ( 2 Samuel 5:5-9;   1 Chronicles 11:4-8) . Here he built an altar to the Lord on the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite ( 2 Samuel 24:15-25 ), and thither he brought up the ark of the covenant and placed it in the new tabernacle which he had prepared for it. Jerusalem now became the capital of the kingdom.", "After the death of David, Solomon built the temple, a house for the name of the Lord, on Mount Moriah (B.C. 1010). He also greatly strengthened and adorned the city, and it became the great centre of all the civil and religious affairs of the nation ( Deuteronomy 12:5 ; comp.  12:14 ;  14:23 ;  16:11-16 ; Psalms 122).", "After the disruption of the kingdom on the accession to the throne of Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, Jerusalem became the capital of the kingdom of the two tribes. It was subsequently often taken and retaken by the Egyptians, the Assyrians, and by the kings of Israel ( 2 Kings 14:13, 14 ;  18:15, 16 ;  23:33-35 ;  24:14 ;  2 Chronicles 12:9 ;  26:9 ;  27:3, 4 ;  29:3 ;  32:30 ;  33:11 ), till finally, for the abounding iniquities of the nation, after a siege of three years, it was taken and utterly destroyed, its walls razed to the ground, and its temple and palaces consumed by fire, by Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon (2 Kings 25; 2 Chronicles 36; Jeremiah 39), B.C. 588. The desolation of the city and the land was completed by the retreat of the principal Jews into Egypt ( Jeremiah 40-44 ), and by the final carrying captive into Babylon of all that still remained in the land ( 52:3 ), so that it was left without an inhabitant (B.C. 582). Compare the predictions, Deuteronomy 28;  Leviticus 26:14-39 .", "But the streets and walls of Jerusalem were again to be built, in troublous times ( Daniel 9:16, 19, 25 ), after a captivity of seventy years. This restoration was begun B.C. 536, \"in the first year of Cyrus\" ( Ezra 1:2, 3, 5 -11). The Books of Ezra and Nehemiah contain the history of the re-building of the city and temple, and the restoration of the kingdom of the Jews, consisting of a portion of all the tribes. The kingdom thus constituted was for two centuries under the dominion of Persia, till B.C. 331; and thereafter, for about a century and a half, under the rulers of the Greek empire in Asia, till B.C. 167. For a century the Jews maintained their independence under native rulers, the Asmonean princes. At the close of this period they fell under the rule of Herod and of members of his family, but practically under Rome, till the time of the destruction of Jerusalem, A.D. 70. The city was then laid in ruins.", "The modern Jerusalem by-and-by began to be built over the immense beds of rubbish resulting from the overthrow of the ancient city; and whilst it occupies certainly the same site, there are no evidences that even the lines of its streets are now what they were in the ancient city. Till A.D. 131 the Jews who still lingered about Jerusalem quietly submitted to the Roman sway. But in that year the emperor (Hadrian), in order to hold them in subjection, rebuilt and fortified the city. The Jews, however, took possession of it, having risen under the leadership of one Bar-Chohaba (i.e., \"the son of the star\") in revolt against the Romans. Some four years afterwards (A.D. 135), however, they were driven out of it with great slaughter, and the city was again destroyed; and over its ruins was built a Roman city called Aelia Capitolina, a name which it retained till it fell under the dominion of the Mohammedans, when it was called el-Khuds, i.e., \"the holy.\"", "In A.D. 326 Helena, mother of the emperor Constantine, made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem with the view of discovering the places mentioned in the life of our Lord. She caused a church to be built on what was then supposed to be the place of the nativity at Bethlehem. Constantine, animated by her example, searched for the holy sepulchre, and built over the supposed site a magnificent church, which was completed and dedicated A.D. 335. He relaxed the laws against the Jews till this time in force, and permitted them once a year to visit the city and wail over the desolation of \"the holy and beautiful house.\"", "In A.D. 614 the Persians, after defeating the Roman forces of the emperor Heraclius, took Jerusalem by storm, and retained it till A.D. 637, when it was taken by the Arabians under the Khalif Omar. It remained in their possession till it passed, in A.D. 960, under the dominion of the Fatimite khalifs of Egypt, and in A.D. 1073 under the Turcomans. In A.D. 1099 the crusader Godfrey of Bouillon took the city from the Moslems with great slaughter, and was elected king of Jerusalem. He converted the Mosque of Omar into a Christian cathedral. During the eighty-eight years which followed, many churches and convents were erected in the holy city. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was rebuilt during this period, and it alone remains to this day. In A.D. 1187 the sultan Saladin wrested the city from the Christians. From that time to the present day, with few intervals, Jerusalem has remained in the hands of the Moslems. It has, however, during that period been again and again taken and retaken, demolished in great part and rebuilt, no city in the world having passed through so many vicissitudes.", "In the year 1850 the Greek and Latin monks residing in Jerusalem had a fierce dispute about the guardianship of what are called the \"holy places.\" In this dispute the emperor Nicholas of Russia sided with the Greeks, and Louis Napoleon, the emperor of the French, with the Latins. This led the Turkish authorities to settle the question in a way unsatisfactory to Russia. Out of this there sprang the Crimean War, which was protracted and sanguinary, but which had important consequences in the way of breaking down the barriers of Turkish exclusiveness.", "Modern Jerusalem \"lies near the summit of a broad mountain-ridge, which extends without interruption from the plain of Esdraelon to a line drawn between the southern end of the Dead Sea and the southeastern corner of the Mediterranean.\" This high, uneven table-land is everywhere from 20 to 25 geographical miles in breadth. It was anciently known as the mountains of Ephraim and Judah.", "\"Jerusalem is a city of contrasts, and differs widely from Damascus, not merely because it is a stone town in mountains, whilst the latter is a mud city in a plain, but because while in Damascus Moslem religion and Oriental custom are unmixed with any foreign element, in Jerusalem every form of religion, every nationality of East and West, is represented at one time.\"", "Jerusalem is first mentioned under that name in the Book of Joshua, and the Tell-el-Amarna collection of tablets includes six letters from its Amorite king to Egypt, recording the attack of the Abiri about B.C. 1480. The name is there spelt Uru-Salim (\"city of peace\"). Another monumental record in which the Holy City is named is that of Sennacherib's attack in B.C. 702. The \"camp of the Assyrians\" was still shown about A.D. 70, on the flat ground to the north-west, included in the new quarter of the city.", "The city of David included both the upper city and Millo, and was surrounded by a wall built by David and Solomon, who appear to have restored the original Jebusite fortifications. The name Zion (or Sion) appears to have been, like Ariel (\"the hearth of God\"), a poetical term for Jerusalem, but in the Greek age was more specially used of the Temple hill. The priests' quarter grew up on Ophel, south of the Temple, where also was Solomon's Palace outside the original city of David. The walls of the city were extended by Jotham and Manasseh to include this suburb and the Temple ( 2 Chronicles 27:3 ;  33:14 ).", "Jerusalem is now a town of some 50,000 inhabitants, with ancient mediaeval walls, partly on the old lines, but extending less far to the south. The traditional sites, as a rule, were first shown in the 4th and later centuries A.D., and have no authority. The results of excavation have, however, settled most of the disputed questions, the limits of the Temple area, and the course of the old walls having been traced."], "Word": "Jerusalem", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "2": {"Definitions": ["vision of peace"], "Word": "Jerusalem", "Dictionary": "Hitchcock's Names Dictionary"}, "3": {"Definitions": ["Called:", "Jebus Joshua 18:28 ;  Judges 19:10", "Zion 1 Kings 8:1 ;  Zech 9:13", "City of David 2 Samuel 5:7 ;  Isaiah 22:9", "Salem Genesis 14:18 ;  Psalms 76:2", "Ariel Isaiah 29:1", "City of God Psalms 46:4", "City of the Great King Psalms 48:2", "City of Judah 2 Chronicles 25:28", "The Perfection of Beauty, the Joy of the Whole Earth Lamentations 2:15", "The Throne of the Lord Jeremiah 3:17", "Holy Mountain Daniel 9:16 ;  Daniel 9:20", "Holy City Nehemiah 11:1 ;  Nehemiah 11:18 ;  Matthew 4:5", "City of Solemnities Isaiah 33:20", "City of Truth Zech 8:3", "The Lord Our Righteousness Jeremiah 33:16", "Jehovah-Shammah Ezekiel 48:35", "New Jerusalem Revelation 21:2 ;  Revelation 21:10-27", "Situation and appearance of Psalms 122:3 ;  Psalms 125:2 ;  Song of Solomon 6:4 ;  Micah 4:8", "Walls of Jeremiah 39:4", "Gates of:", "Old Gate, Fish Gate, Sheep Gate, Prison Gate Nehemiah 3:1 ;  Nehemiah 3:3 ;  Nehemiah 3:32 ;  Nehemiah 12:39", "Gate of Ephraim 2 Chronicles 25:23 ;  Nehemiah 12:39", "Gate of Benjamin Jeremiah 37:13 ;  Zech 14:10", "Gate of Joshua 2 Kings 23:8", "Old Gate Nehemiah 3:6 ;  Nehemiah 12:39", "Corner Gate Zech 14:10", "Valley Gate Nehemiah 2:13 ;  Nehemiah 3:13", "Dung Gate Nehemiah 2:13 ;  Nehemiah 3:13 ;  Nehemiah 12:31", "Gate of the Fountain Nehemiah 2:14 ;  Nehemiah 3:15 ;  Nehemiah 12:37", "Water Gate Nehemiah 3:26 ;  Nehemiah 8:1 ;  Nehemiah 12:37", "Horse Gate Nehemiah 3:28", "King's Gate 1 Chronicles 9:18", "Shallecheth Gate 1 Chronicles 26:16", "High Gate 2 Chronicles 23:20", "East Gate Nehemiah 3:29", "Miphkad Gate Nehemiah 3:31", "Middle Gate Jeremiah 39:3", "First Gate Zech 14:10", "Buildings:", "Buildings: John 18:15", "Castle Acts 21:34", "Stairs Nehemiah 3:15", "Streets:", "East Street 2 Chronicles 29:4", "Street of the House of God Ezra 10:9", "Street of the Water Gate Nehemiah 8:16", "Street of the Gate of Ephraim Nehemiah 8:16", "Baker's Street Jeremiah 37:21", "Towers of Hananeel ;  Meah ;  Millo ;  Ophel ;  Siloam", "Places in and around:", "Moriah 2 Chronicles 3:1", "The sepulcher of Jesus John 19:41 Calvary ;  Gethsemane ;  Olives, Mount of ;  Jehoshaphat, 6.

( Joshua 3:16 ) It was five miles west of the Jordan and seven miles northwest of the Dead Sea. It had a king. Its walls were so considerable that houses were built upon them. ch. ( Joshua 2:15 ) The spoil that was found in it betokened its affluence. Jericho is first mentioned as the city to which the two spies were sent by Joshua from Shittim. ( Joshua 2:1-21 ) It was bestowed by him upon the tribe of Benjamin, ch. ( Joshua 18:21 ) and from this time a long interval elapses before Jericho appears again upon the scene. Its second foundation under Hiel the Bethelite is recorded in ( 1 Kings 16:34 ) Once rebuilt, Jericho rose again slowly into consequence. In its immediate vicinity the sons of the prophets sought retirement from the world; Elisha \"healed the spring of the waters;\" and over against it, beyond Jordan, Elijah \"went up by a whirlwind into heaven.\" ( 2 Kings 2:1-22 ) In its plains Zedekiah fell into the hands of the Chaldeans. ( 2 Kings 25:5 ;  Jeremiah 39:5 ) In the return under Zerubbabel the \"children of Jericho,\" 345 in number, are comprised. ( Ezra 2:34 ;  Nehemiah 7:36 ) Under Herod the Great it again became an important place. He fortified it and built a number of new palaces, which he named after his friends. If he did not make Jericho his habitual residence, he at last retired thither to die, and it was in the amphitheater of Jericho that the news of his death was announced to the assembled soldiers and people by Salome. Soon afterward the palace was burnt and the town plundered by one Simon, slave to Herod; but Archelaus rebuilt the former sumptuously, and founded a new town on the plain, that bore his own name; and, most important of all, diverted water from a village called Ne'ra to irrigate the plain which he had planted with palms. Thus Jericho was once more \"a city of palms\" when our Lord visited it. Here he restored sight to the blind. ( Matthew 20:30 ;  Mark 10:46 ;  Luke 18:35 ) Here the descendant of Rahab did not disdain the hospitality of Zacc'us the publican. Finally, between Jerusalem and Jericho was laid the scene of his story of the good Samaritan. The city was destroyed by Vespasian. The site of ancient (the first) Jericho is placed by Dr. Robinson in the immediate neighborhood of the fountain of Elisha; and that of the second (the city of the New Testament and of Josephus) at the opening of the  Wady Kelt  (Cherith), half an hour from the fountain. (The village identified with jericho lies a mile and a half from the ancient site, and is called  Riha  . It contains probably 200 inhabitants, indolent and licentious and about 40 houses.

One of the \"greater prophets\" of the Old Testament, son of Hilkiah (q.v.), a priest of Anathoth ( Jeremiah 1:1 ;  32:6 ). He was called to the prophetical office when still young ( 1:6 ), in the thirteenth year of Josiah (B.C. 628). He left his native place, and went to reside in Jerusalem, where he greatly assisted Josiah in his work of reformation ( 2 Kings 23:1-25 ). The death of this pious king was bewailed by the prophet as a national calamity ( 2 Chronicles 35:25 ).", "During the three years of the reign of Jehoahaz we find no reference to Jeremiah, but in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the enmity of the people against him broke out in bitter persecution, and he was placed apparently under restraint ( Jeremiah 36:5 ). In the fourth year of Jehoiakim he was commanded to write the predictions given to him, and to read them to the people on the fast-day. This was done by Baruch his servant in his stead, and produced much public excitement. The roll was read to the king. In his recklessness he seized the roll, and cut it to pieces, and cast it into the fire, and ordered both Baruch and Jeremiah to be apprehended. Jeremiah procured another roll, and wrote in it the words of the roll the king had destroyed, and \"many like words\" besides ( Jeremiah 36:32 ).", "He remained in Jerusalem, uttering from time to time his words of warning, but without effect. He was there when Nebuchadnezzar besieged the city ( Jeremiah 37:4, 5 ), B.C. 589. The rumour of the approach of the Egyptians to aid the Jews in this crisis induced the Chaldeans to withdraw and return to their own land. This, however, was only for a time. The prophet, in answer to his prayer, received a message from God announcing that the Chaldeans would come again and take the city, and burn it with fire ( 37:7, 8 ). The princes, in their anger at such a message by Jeremiah, cast him into prison ( 37:15-38:13 ). He was still in confinement when the city was taken (B.C. 588). The Chaldeans released him, and showed him great kindness, allowing him to choose the place of his residence. He accordingly went to Mizpah with Gedaliah, who had been made governor of Judea. Johanan succeeded Gedaliah, and refusing to listen to Jeremiah's counsels, went down into Egypt, taking Jeremiah and Baruch with him ( Jeremiah 43:6 ). There probably the prophet spent the remainder of his life, in vain seeking still to turn the people to the Lord, from whom they had so long revolted (44). He lived till the reign of Evil-Merodach, son of Nebuchadnezzar, and must have been about ninety years of age at his death. We have no authentic record of his death. He may have died at Tahpanhes, or, according to a tradition, may have gone to Babylon with the army of Nebuchadnezzar; but of this there is nothing certain."], "Word": "Jeremiah", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "2": {"Definitions": ["exaltation of the Lord"], "Word": "Jeremiah", "Dictionary": "Hitchcock's Names Dictionary"}, "3": {"Definitions": ["1.
