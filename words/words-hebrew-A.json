It is probable that \"Uriel of Gibeah\" married Tamar, the daughter of Absalom ( 2 Samuel 14:27 ), and by her had Maachah.

He remained with David, and became priest of the party of which he was the leader ( 1 Samuel 30:7 ). When David ascended the throne of Judah, Abiathar was appointed high priest ( 1 Chronicles 15:11 ;  1 Kings 2:26 ) and the \"king's companion\" ( 1 Chronicles 27:34 ). Meanwhile Zadok, of the house of Eleazar, had been made high priest. These appointments continued in force till the end of David's reign ( 1 Kings 4:4 ). Abiathar was deposed (the sole historical instance of the deposition of a high priest) and banished to his home at Anathoth by Solomon, because he took part in the attempt to raise Adonijah to the throne. The priesthood thus passed from the house of Ithamar ( 1 Samuel 2:30-36 ;  1 Kings 1:19 ;  2:26, 27 ). Zadok now became sole high priest. In  Mark 2:26 , reference is made to an occurrence in \"the days of Abiathar the high priest.\" But from 1 Samuel 22, we learn explicitly that this event took place when Ahimelech, the father of Abiathar, was high priest. The apparent discrepancy is satisfactorily explained by interpreting the words in Mark as referring to the life-time of Abiathar, and not to the term of his holding the office of high priest. It is not implied in Mark that he was actual high priest at the time referred to.
