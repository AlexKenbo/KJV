It is probable that \"Uriel of Gibeah\" married Tamar, the daughter of Absalom ( 2 Samuel 14:27 ), and by her had Maachah.

He remained with David, and became priest of the party of which he was the leader ( 1 Samuel 30:7 ). When David ascended the throne of Judah, Abiathar was appointed high priest ( 1 Chronicles 15:11 ;  1 Kings 2:26 ) and the \"king's companion\" ( 1 Chronicles 27:34 ). Meanwhile Zadok, of the house of Eleazar, had been made high priest. These appointments continued in force till the end of David's reign ( 1 Kings 4:4 ). Abiathar was deposed (the sole historical instance of the deposition of a high priest) and banished to his home at Anathoth by Solomon, because he took part in the attempt to raise Adonijah to the throne. The priesthood thus passed from the house of Ithamar ( 1 Samuel 2:30-36 ;  1 Kings 1:19 ;  2:26, 27 ). Zadok now became sole high priest. In  Mark 2:26 , reference is made to an occurrence in \"the days of Abiathar the high priest.\" But from 1 Samuel 22, we learn explicitly that this event took place when Ahimelech, the father of Abiathar, was high priest. The apparent discrepancy is satisfactorily explained by interpreting the words in Mark as referring to the life-time of Abiathar, and not to the term of his holding the office of high priest. It is not implied in Mark that he was actual high priest at the time referred to.

The first public act of his life was the blood-revenge he executed against Amnon, David's eldest son, who had basely wronged Absalom's sister Tamar. This revenge was executed at the time of the festivities connected with a great sheep-shearing at Baal-hazor. David's other sons fled from the place in horror, and brought the tidings of the death of Amnon to Jerusalem. Alarmed for the consequences of the act, Absalom fled to his grandfather at Geshur, and there abode for three years ( 2 Samuel 3:3 ;  13:23-38 ).", "David mourned his absent son, now branded with the guilt of fratricide. As the result of a stratagem carried out by a woman of Tekoah, Joab received David's sanction to invite Absalom back to Jerusalem. He returned accordingly, but two years elapsed before his father admitted him into his presence ( 2 Samuel 14:28 ). Absalom was now probably the oldest surviving son of David, and as he was of royal descent by his mother as well as by his father, he began to aspire to the throne. His pretensions were favoured by the people. By many arts he gained their affection; and after his return from Geshur ( 2 Samuel 15:7 ; marg., R.V.) he went up to Hebron, the old capital of Judah, along with a great body of the people, and there proclaimed himself king. The revolt was so successful that David found it necessary to quit Jerusalem and flee to Mahanaim, beyond Jordan; where upon Absalom returned to Jerusalem and took possession of the throne without opposition. Ahithophel, who had been David's chief counsellor, deserted him and joined Absalom, whose chief counsellor he now became. Hushai also joined Absalom, but only for the purpose of trying to counteract the counsels of Ahithophel, and so to advantage David's cause. He was so far successful that by his advice, which was preferred to that of Ahithophel, Absalom delayed to march an army against his father, who thus gained time to prepare for the defence.", "Absalom at length marched out against his father, whose army, under the command of Joab, he encountered on the borders of the forest of Ephraim. Twenty thousand of Absalom's army were slain in that fatal battle, and the rest fled. Absalom fled on a swift mule; but his long flowing hair, or more probably his head, was caught in the bough of an oak, and there he was left suspended till Joab came up and pierced him through with three darts. His body was then taken down and cast into a pit dug in the forest, and a heap of stones was raised over his grave. When the tidings of the result of that battle were brought to David, as he sat impatiently at the gate of Mahanaim, and he was told that Absalom had been slain, he gave way to the bitter lamentation: \"O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!\" ( 2 Samuel 18:33 .

He brooded over the wrong for two years, and then invited all the princes to a sheep-shearing feast at his estate in Baalhazor, on the borders of Ephraim and Benjamin. Here he ordered his servants to murder Amnon, and then fled for safety to his grandfather's court at Geshur, where he remained for three years. At the end of that time he was brought back by an artifice of Joab. David, however, would not see Absalom for two more years; but at length Joab brought about a reconciliation. Absalom now began at once to prepare for rebellion. He tried to supplant his father by courting popularity, standing in the gate, conversing with every suitor, and lamenting the difficulty which he would find in getting a hearing. He also maintained a splendid retinue, ( 2 Samuel 15:1 ) and was admired for his personal beauty. It is probable too that the great tribe of Judah had taken some offence at David's government. Absalom raised the standard of revolt at Hebron, the old capital of Judah, now supplanted by Jerusalem. The revolt was at first completely successful; David fled from his capital over the Jordan to Mahanaim in Gilead, and Absalom occupied Jerusalem. At last, after being solemnly anointed king at Jerusalem, ( 2 Samuel 19:10 ) Absalom crossed the Jordan to attack his father, who by this time had rallied round him a considerable force. A decisive battle was fought in Gilead, in the wood of Ephraim. Here Absalom's forces were totally defeated, and as he himself was escaping his long hair was entangled in the branches of a terebinth, where he was left hanging while the mule on which he was riding ran away from under him. He was dispatched by Joab in spite of the prohibition of David, who, loving him to the last, had desired that his life might be spared.

Abiathar was deposed (the sole historical instance of the deposition of a high priest) and banished to his home at Anathoth by Solomon, because he took part in the attempt to raise Adonijah to the throne. The priesthood thus passed from the house of Ithamar ( 1 Samuel 2:30-36 ;  1 Kings 1:19 ;  2:26, 27 ). Zadok now became sole high priest. In  Mark 2:26 , reference is made to an occurrence in \"the days of Abiathar the high priest.\" But from 1 Samuel 22, we learn explicitly that this event took place when Ahimelech, the father of Abiathar, was high priest. The apparent discrepancy is satisfactorily explained by interpreting the words in Mark as referring to the life-time of Abiathar, and not to the term of his holding the office of high priest. It is not implied in Mark that he was actual high priest at the time referred to. Others, however, think that the loaves belonged to Abiathar, who was at that time ( Leviticus 24:9 ) a priest, and that he either himself gave them to David, or persuaded his father to give them."], "Word": "Abiathar", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "2": {"Definitions": ["excellent father; father of the remnant"], "Word": "Abiathar", "Dictionary": "Hitchcock's Names Dictionary"}, "3": {"Definitions": ["1.

A few years after this Abimelech visited Abraham, who had removed southward beyond his territory, and there entered into a league of peace and friendship with him.

Till the age of seventy, Abram sojourned among his kindred in his native country of Chaldea. He then, with his father and his family and household, quitted the city of Ur, in which he had hitherto dwelt, and went some 300 miles north to Haran, where he abode fifteen years. The cause of his migration was a call from God ( Acts 7:2-4 ). There is no mention of this first call in the Old Testament; it is implied, however, in Genesis 12. While they tarried at Haran, Terah died at the age of 205 years. Abram now received a second and more definite call, accompanied by a promise from God ( Genesis 12:1, 2 ); whereupon he took his departure, taking his nephew Lot with him, \"not knowing whither he went\" ( Hebrews 11:8 ). He trusted implicitly to the guidance of Him who had called him.", "Abram now, with a large household of probably a thousand souls, entered on a migratory life, and dwelt in tents. Passing along the valley of the Jabbok, in the land of Canaan, he formed his first encampment at Sichem ( Genesis 12:6 ), in the vale or oak-grove of Moreh, between Ebal on the north and Gerizim on the south. Here he received the great promise, \"I will make of thee a great nation,\" etc. ( Genesis 12:2, 3, 7 ). This promise comprehended not only temporal but also spiritual blessings. It implied that he was the chosen ancestor of the great Deliverer whose coming had been long ago predicted ( Genesis 3:15 ). Soon after this, for some reason not mentioned, he removed his tent to the mountain district between Bethel, then called Luz, and Ai, towns about two miles apart, where he built an altar to \"Jehovah.\" He again moved into the southern tract of Palestine, called by the Hebrews the Negeb; and was at length, on account of a famine, compelled to go down into Egypt. This took place in the time of the Hyksos, a Semitic race which now held the Egyptians in bondage. Here occurred that case of deception on the part of Abram which exposed him to the rebuke of Pharaoh ( Genesis 12:18 ). Sarai was restored to him; and Pharaoh loaded him with presents, recommending him to withdraw from the country. He returned to Canaan richer than when he left it, \"in cattle, in silver, and in gold\" ( Genesis 12:8 ;  13:2 . Comp.  Psalms 105:13, 14 ). The whole party then moved northward, and returned to their previous station near Bethel. Here disputes arose between Lot's shepherds and those of Abram about water and pasturage. Abram generously gave Lot his choice of the pasture-ground. (Comp.  1 Corinthians 6:7 .) He chose the well-watered plain in which Sodom was situated, and removed thither; and thus the uncle and nephew were separated. Immediately after this Abram was cheered by a repetition of the promises already made to him, and then removed to the plain or \"oak-grove\" of Mamre, which is in Hebron. He finally settled here, pitching his tent under a famous oak or terebinth tree, called \"the oak of Mamre\" ( Genesis 13:18 ). This was his third resting-place in the land.", "Some fourteen years before this, while Abram was still in Chaldea, Palestine had been invaded by Chedorlaomer, King of Elam, who brought under tribute to him the five cities in the plain to which Lot had removed. This tribute was felt by the inhabitants of these cities to be a heavy burden, and after twelve years they revolted. This brought upon them the vengeance of Chedorlaomer, who had in league with him four other kings. He ravaged the whole country, plundering the towns, and carrying the inhabitants away as slaves. Among those thus treated was Lot. Hearing of the disaster that had fallen on his nephew, Abram immediately gathered from his own household a band of 318 armed men, and being joined by the Amoritish chiefs Mamre, Aner, and Eshcol, he pursued after Chedorlaomer, and overtook him near the springs of the Jordan. They attacked and routed his army, and pursued it over the range of Anti-Libanus as far as to Hobah, near Damascus, and then returned, bringing back all the spoils that had been carried away. Returning by way of Salem, i.e., Jerusalem, the king of that place, Melchizedek, came forth to meet them with refreshments. To him Abram presented a tenth of the spoils, in recognition of his character as a priest of the most high God ( Genesis 14:18-20 ).", "In a recently-discovered tablet, dated in the reign of the grandfather of Amraphel ( Genesis 14:1 ), one of the witnesses is called \"the Amorite, the son of Abiramu,\" or Abram.", "Having returned to his home at Mamre, the promises already made to him by God were repeated and enlarged ( Genesis 13:14 ). \"The word of the Lord\" (an expression occurring here for the first time) \"came to him\" ( 15:1 ). He now understood better the future that lay before the nation that was to spring from him. Sarai, now seventy-five years old, in her impatience, persuaded Abram to take Hagar, her Egyptian maid, as a concubine, intending that whatever child might be born should be reckoned as her own. Ishmael was accordingly thus brought up, and was regarded as the heir of these promises (Genesis 16). When Ishmael was thirteen years old, God again revealed yet more explicitly and fully his gracious purpose; and in token of the sure fulfilment of that purpose the patriarch's name was now changed from Abram to Abraham ( Genesis 17:4, 5 ), and the rite of circumcision was instituted as a sign of the covenant. It was then announced that the heir to these covenant promises would be the son of Sarai, though she was now ninety years old; and it was directed that his name should be Isaac. At the same time, in commemoration of the promises, Sarai's name was changed to Sarah. On that memorable day of God's thus revealing his design, Abraham and his son Ishmael and all the males of his house were circumcised (Genesis 17). Three months after this, as Abraham sat in his tent door, he saw three men approaching. They accepted his proffered hospitality, and, seated under an oak-tree, partook of the fare which Abraham and Sarah provided. One of the three visitants was none other than the Lord, and the other two were angels in the guise of men. The Lord renewed on this occasion his promise of a son by Sarah, who was rebuked for her unbelief. Abraham accompanied the three as they proceeded on their journey. The two angels went on toward Sodom; while the Lord tarried behind and talked with Abraham, making known to him the destruction that was about to fall on that guilty city. The patriarch interceded earnestly in behalf of the doomed city. But as not even ten righteous persons were found in it, for whose sake the city would have been spared, the threatened destruction fell upon it; and early next morning Abraham saw the smoke of the fire that consumed it as the \"smoke of a furnace\" ( Genesis 19:1-28 ).", "After fifteen years' residence at Mamre, Abraham moved southward, and pitched his tent among the Philistines, near to Gerar. Here occurred that sad instance of prevarication on his part in his relation to Abimelech the King (Genesis 20). (See  ABIMELECH .) Soon after this event, the patriarch left the vicinity of Gerar, and moved down the fertile valley about 25 miles to Beer-sheba. It was probably here that Isaac was born, Abraham being now an hundred years old. A feeling of jealousy now arose between Sarah and Hagar, whose son, Ishmael, was no longer to be regarded as Abraham's heir. Sarah insisted that both Hagar and her son should be sent away. This was done, although it was a hard trial to Abraham ( Genesis 21:12 ). (See  HAGAR ;  ISHMAEL .)", "At this point there is a blank in the patriarch's history of perhaps twenty-five years. These years of peace and happiness were spent at Beer-sheba. The next time we see him his faith is put to a severe test by the command that suddenly came to him to go and offer up Isaac, the heir of all the promises, as a sacrifice on one of the mountains of Moriah. His faith stood the test ( Hebrews 11:17-19 ). He proceeded in a spirit of unhesitating obedience to carry out the command; and when about to slay his son, whom he had laid on the altar, his uplifted hand was arrested by the angel of Jehovah, and a ram, which was entangled in a thicket near at hand, was seized and offered in his stead. From this circumstance that place was called Jehovah-jireh, i.e., \"The Lord will provide.\" The promises made to Abraham were again confirmed (and this was the last recorded word of God to the patriarch); and he descended the mount with his son, and returned to his home at Beer-sheba ( Genesis 22:19 ), where he resided for some years, and then moved northward to Hebron.", "Some years after this Sarah died at Hebron, being 127 years old. Abraham acquired now the needful possession of a burying-place, the cave of Machpelah, by purchase from the owner of it, Ephron the Hittite ( Genesis 23 ); and there he buried Sarah. His next care was to provide a wife for Isaac, and for this purpose he sent his steward, Eliezer, to Haran (or Charran,  Acts 7:2 ), where his brother Nahor and his family resided ( Genesis 11:31 ). The result was that Rebekah, the daughter of Nahor's son Bethuel, became the wife of Isaac (Genesis 24). Abraham then himself took to wife Keturah, who became the mother of six sons, whose descendants were afterwards known as the \"children of the east\" ( Judges 6:3 ), and later as \"Saracens.\" At length all his wanderings came to an end. At the age of 175 years, 100 years after he had first entered the land of Canaan, he died, and was buried in the old family burying-place at Machpelah ( Genesis 25:7-10 ).", "The history of Abraham made a wide and deep impression on the ancient world, and references to it are interwoven in the religious traditions of almost all Eastern nations. He is called \"the friend of God\" ( James 2:23 ), \"faithful Abraham\" ( Galatians 3:9 ), \"the father of us all\" ( Romans 4:16 )."], "Word": "Abraham", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "2": {"Definitions": ["father of a great multitude"], "Word": "Abraham", "Dictionary": "Hitchcock's Names Dictionary"}, "3": {"Definitions": ["Called also Abram.", "Son of Terah Genesis 11:26-27", "Marries Sarah Genesis 11:29", "Dwells in Ur, but removes to Haran Genesis 11:31 ;  Nehemiah 9:7 ;  Acts 7:4", "Dwells in Canaan Genesis 12:4-6 ;  Acts 7:4", "Divine call of Genesis 12:1-3 ;  Joshua 24:3 ;  Nehemiah 9:7 ;  Isaiah 51:2 ;  Acts 7:2-3 ;  Hebrews 11:8", "Canaan given to Genesis 12:1 ;  Genesis 12:7 ;  Genesis 15:7-21 ;  Ezekiel 33:24", "Dwells in Beth-El Genesis 12:8", "Sojourns in Egypt Genesis 12:10-20 ;  Genesis 26:1", "Deferring to Lot, chooses Hebron Genesis 1:13 ;  Genesis 14:13 ;  Genesis 35:27", "Dwells in Gerar Genesis 1:20 ;  Genesis 21:22-34", "Defeats Chedorlaomer Genesis 14:5-24 ;  Hebrews 7:1", "Is blessed by Melchizedek Genesis 14:18-20 ;  Hebrews 7:1-10", "God's covenant with Hebrews 1:15 ;  Genesis 17:1-22 ;  Micah 7:20 ;  Luke 1:73 ;  Romans 4:13 ;  Romans 15:8 ;  Hebrews 6:13-14 ;  Galatians 3:6-18 ;  Galatians 3:29 ;  Galatians 4:22-31", "Name changed to Abraham Genesis 17:5 ;  Nehemiah 9:7", "Circumcision of Genesis 17:10-14 ;  Genesis 17:23-27", "Angels appear to Genesis 18:1-16 ;  Genesis 22:11 ;  Genesis 22:15 ;  Genesis 24:7", "His questions about the destruction of the righteous and wicked in Sodom Genesis 18:23-32", "Witnesses the destruction of Sodom Genesis 19:27-28", "Ishmael born to Genesis 16:3 ;  Genesis 16:15", "Dwells in Gerar; deceives Abimelech concerning Sarah, his wife Genesis 1:20", "Isaac born to Genesis 21:2-3 ;  Galatians 4:22-30", "Sends Hagar and Ishmael away Genesis 21:10-14 ;  Galatians 4:22-30", "Trial of his faith in the offering of Isaac Genesis 22:1-19 ;  Hebrews 11:17 ;  James 2:21", "Sarah, his wife, dies Genesis 23:1-2", "He purchases a place for her burial, and buries her in a cave Genesis 23:3-20", "Marries Keturah Genesis 25:1", "Provides a wife for Isaac Genesis 1:24", "Children of Genesis 16:15 ;  Genesis 21:2-3 ;  Genesis 25:1-4 ;  1 Chronicles 1:32-34", "Testament of Genesis 25:5-6", "Wealth of Genesis 13:2 ;  Genesis 24:35 ;  Isaiah 51:2", "Age of, at different periods Genesis 12:4 ;  Genesis 16:16 ;  Genesis 21:5 ;  Genesis 25:7", "Death of Genesis 15:15 ;  Genesis 25:8-10", "In Paradise Matthew 8:11 ;  Luke 13:28 ;  Luke 16:22-31", "Friend of God Isaiah 41:8 ;  2 Chronicles 20:7 ;  James 2:23", "Piety of Genesis 12:7-8 ;  Genesis 13:4 ;  Genesis 13:18 ;  Genesis 18:19 ;  Genesis 20:7 ;  Genesis 21:33 ;  Genesis 22:3-13 ;  Genesis 26:5 ;  Nehemiah 9:7-8 ;  Romans 4:16-18 ;  2 Chronicles 20:7 ;  Isaiah 41:8 ;  James 2:23", "A prophet Genesis 20:7", "Faith of Genesis 15:6 ;  Romans 4:1-22 ;  Galatians 3:6-9 ;  Hebrews 11:8-10 ;  Hebrews 11:17-19 ;  James 2:21-24", "Unselfishness of Genesis 13:9 ;  Genesis 21:25-30", "Independence of, in character Genesis 14:23 ;  Genesis 23:6-16", "Ancestors of, idolatrous Joshua 24:2", "How regarded by his descendants Matthew 3:9 ;  Luke 13:16 ;  Luke 13:28 ;  Luke 19:9 ;  John 8:33-40 ;  John 8:52-59"], "Word": "Abraham", "Dictionary": "Naves Topical Index"}, "4": {"Definitions": ["( father of a multitude ) was the son of Terah, and founder of the great Hebrew nation. (B.C. 1996-1822.) His family, a branch of the descendants of Shem, was settled in Ur of the Chaldees, beyond the Euphrates, where Abraham was born. Terah had two other sons, Nahor and Haran. Haran died before his father in Ur of the Chaldees, leaving a son, Lot; and Terah, taking with him Abram, with Sarai his wife and his grandson Lot, emigrated to Haran in Mesopotamia, where he died.", "On the death of his father, Abram, then in the 75th year of his age, with Sarai and Lot, pursued his course to the land of Canaan, whither he was directed by divine command, ( Genesis 12:5 ) when he received the general promise that he should become the founder of a great nation, and that all the families of the earth should be blessed in him.", "He passed through the heart of the country by the great highway to Shechem, and pitched his tent beneath the terebinth of Moreh. ( Genesis 12:6 ) Here he received in vision from Jehovah the further revelation that this was the land which his descendants should inherit. ( Genesis 12:7 ) The next halting-place of the wanderer was on a mountain between Bethel and Ai, ( Genesis 12:8 ) but the country was suffering from famine, and Abram journeyed still southward to the rich cornlands of Egypt.", "There, fearing that the great beauty of Sarai might tempt the powerful monarch of Egypt and expose his own life to peril, he arranged that Sarai should represent herself as his sister, which her actual relationship to him, as probably the daughter of his brother Haran, allowed her to do with some semblance of truth. But her beauty was reported to the king, and she was taken into the royal harem. The deception was discovered, and Pharaoh with some indignation dismissed Abram from the country. ( Genesis 12:10-20 ) He left Egypt with great possessions, and, accompanied by Lot, returned by the south of Palestine to his former encampment between Bethel and Ai.", "The increased wealth of the two kinsmen was the ultimate cause of their separation. Lot chose the fertile plain of the Jordan near Sodom, while Abram pitched his tent among the groves of Mamre, close to Hebron. ( Genesis 13:1 ) ... Lot with his family and possessions having been carried away captive by Chedorlaomer king of Elam, who had invaded Sodom, Abram pursued the conquerors and utterly routed them not far from Damascus. The captives and plunder were all recovered, and Abram was greeted on his return by the king of Sodom, and by Melchizedek king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who mysteriously appears upon the scene to bless the patriarch and receive from him a tenth of the spoil. ( Genesis 14:1 ) ...", "After this the thrice-repeated promise that his descendants should become a mighty nation and possess the land in which he was a stranger was confirmed with all the solemnity of a religious ceremony. ( Genesis 15:1 ) ... Ten years had passed since he had left his father's house, and the fulfillment of the promise was apparently more distant than at first. At the suggestion of Sarai, who despaired of having children of her own, he took as his concubine Hagar, her Egyptian main, who bore him Ishm'l in the 86th year of his age. ( Genesis 16:1 ) ... [HAGAR; ISHM'L] But this was not the accomplishment of the promise. Thirteen years elapsed, during which Abram still dwelt in Hebron, when the covenant was renewed, and the rite of circumcision established as its sign.", "This most important crisis in Abram's life, when he was 99 years old, is marked by the significant change of his name to Abraham, \"father of a multitude;\" while his wife's from Sarai became Sarah. The promise that Sarah should have a son was repeated in the remarkable scene described in ch. 18. Three men stood before Abraham as he sat in his tent door in the heat of the day. The patriarch, with true Eastern hospitality, welcomed the strangers, and bade them rest and refresh themselves. The meal ended, they foretold the birth of Isaac, and went on their way to Sodom. Abraham accompanied them, and is represented as an interlocutor in a dialogue with Jehovah, in which he pleaded in vain to avert the vengeance threatened to the devoted cities of the plain. ( Genesis 18:17-33 )", "In remarkable contrast with Abraham's firm faith with regard to the magnificent fortunes of his posterity stand the incident which occurred during his temporary residence among the Philistines in Gerar, whither he had for some cause removed after the destruction of Sodom. It was almost a repetition of what took place in Egypt a few years before. At length Isaac, the long-looked for child, was born. Sarah's jealousy aroused by the mockery of Ishm'l at the \"great banquet\" which Abram made to celebrate the weaning of her son, ( Genesis 21:9 ) demanded that, with his mother Hagar, he should be driven out. ( Genesis 21:10 ) But the severest trial of his faith was yet to come. For a long period the history is almost silent.", "At length he receives the strange command to take Isaac, his only son, and offer him for a burnt offering at an appointed place Abraham hesitated not to obey. His faith, hitherto unshaken, supported him in this final trial, \"accounting that God was able to raise up his son, even from the dead, from whence also he received him in a figure.\" ( Hebrews 11:19 ) The sacrifice was stayed by the angel of Jehovah, the promise of spiritual blessing made for the first time, and Abraham with his son returned to Beersheba, and for a time dwelt there.

But we find him after a few years in his original residence at Hebron, for there Sarah died, ( Genesis 23:2 ) and was buried in the cave of Machpelah.", "The remaining years of Abraham's life are marked by but few incidents. After Isaac's marriage with Rebekah and his removal to Lahai-roi, Abraham took to wife Keturah, by whom he had six children, Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbok and Shuah, who became the ancestors of nomadic tribes inhabiting the countries south and southeast of Palestine. Abraham lived to see the gradual accomplishment of the promise in the birth of his grandchildren Jacob and Esau, and witnessed their growth to manhood.

He was formed out of the dust of the earth (and hence his name), and God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and gave him dominion over all the lower creatures ( Genesis 1:26 ;  2:7 ). He was placed after his creation in the Garden of Eden, to cultivate it, and to enjoy its fruits under this one prohibition: \"Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.\"", "The first recorded act of Adam was his giving names to the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, which God brought to him for this end.

Some explain the name as meaning mountaineer, others mountain of strength, illuminator. He was born in Egypt three years before his brother Moses, and a number of years after his sister Miriam ( 2:1, 4 ;  7:7 ). He married Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab of the house of Judah ( 6:23 ;  1 Chronicles 2:10 ), by whom he had four sons, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. When the time for the deliverance of Isarael out of Egypt drew nigh, he was sent by God ( Exodus 4:14 ,  27-30 ) to meet his long-absent brother, that he might co-operate with him in all that they were required to do in bringing about the Exodus. He was to be the \"mouth\" or \"prophet\" of Moses, i.e., was to speak for him, because he was a man of a ready utterance ( 7:1, 2, 9, 10, 19 ). He was faithful to his trust, and stood by Moses in all his interviews with Pharaoh.", "When the ransomed tribes fought their first battle with Amalek in Rephidim, Moses stood on a hill overlooking the scene of the conflict with the rod of God in his outstretched hand. On this occasion he was attended by Aaron and Hur, his sister's husband, who held up his wearied hands till Joshua and the chosen warriors of Israel gained the victory ( 17:8-13 ).", "Afterwards, when encamped before Sinai, and when Moses at the command of God ascended the mount to receive the tables of the law, Aaron and his two sons, Nadab and Abihu, along with seventy of the elders of Israel, were permitted to accompany him part of the way, and to behold afar off the manifestation of the glory of Israel's God ( Exodus 19:24 ;  24:9-11 ). While Moses remained on the mountain with God, Aaron returned unto the people; and yielding through fear, or ignorance, or instability of character, to their clamour, made unto them a golden calf, and set it up as an object of worship ( Exodus 32:4 ;  Psalms 106:19 ). On the return of Moses to the camp, Aaron was sternly rebuked by him for the part he had acted in this matter; but he interceded for him before God, who forgave his sin ( Deuteronomy 9:20 ).", "On the mount, Moses received instructions regarding the system of worship which was to be set up among the people; and in accordance therewith Aaron and his sons were consecrated to the priest's office ( Leviticus 8; 9 ). Aaron, as high priest, held henceforth the prominent place appertaining to that office.", "When Israel had reached Hazeroth, in \"the wilderness of Paran,\" Aaron joined with his sister Miriam in murmuring against Moses, \"because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married,\" probably after the death of Zipporah. But the Lord vindicated his servant Moses, and punished Miriam with leprosy (Numbers 12). Aaron acknowledged his own and his sister's guilt, and at the intercession of Moses they were forgiven.", "Twenty years after this, when the children of Israel were encamped in the wilderness of Paran, Korah, Dathan, and Abiram conspired against Aaron and his sons; but a fearful judgment from God fell upon them, and they were destroyed, and the next day thousands of the people also perished by a fierce pestilence, the ravages of which were only stayed by the interposition of Aaron (Numbers 16). That there might be further evidence of the divine appointment of Aaron to the priestly office, the chiefs of the tribes were each required to bring to Moses a rod bearing on it the name of his tribe. And these, along with the rod of Aaron for the tribe of Levi, were laid up overnight in the tabernacle, and in the morning it was found that while the other rods remained unchanged, that of Aaron \"for the house of Levi\" budded, blossomed, and yielded almonds ( Numbers 17:1-10 ). This rod was afterwards preserved in the tabernacle ( Hebrews 9:4 ) as a memorial of the divine attestation of his appointment to the priesthood.", "Aaron was implicated in the sin of his brother at Meribah ( Numbers 20:8-13 ), and on that account was not permitted to enter the Promised Land. When the tribes arrived at Mount Hor, \"in the edge of the land of Edom,\" at the command of God Moses led Aaron and his son Eleazar to the top of that mountain, in the sight of all the people. There he stripped Aaron of his priestly vestments, and put them upon Eleazar; and there Aaron died on the top of the mount, being 123 years old ( Numbers 20:23-29 . Comp.  Deuteronomy 10:6 ;  32:50 ), and was \"gathered unto his people.\" The people, \"even all the house of Israel,\" mourned for him thirty days. Of Aaron's sons two survived him, Eleazar, whose family held the high-priesthood till the time of Eli; and Ithamar, in whose family, beginning with Eli, the high-priesthood was held till the time of Solomon. Aaron's other two sons had been struck dead ( Leviticus 10:1, 2 ) for the daring impiety of offering \"strange fire\" on the alter of incense.", "The Arabs still show with veneration the traditionary site of Aaron's grave on one of the two summits of Mount Hor, which is marked by a Mohammedan chapel. His name is mentioned in the Koran, and there are found in the writings of the rabbins many fabulous stories regarding him.", "He was the first anointed priest. His descendants, \"the house of Aaron,\" constituted the priesthood in general. In the time of David they were very numerous ( 1 Chronicles 12:27 ). The other branches of the tribe of Levi held subordinate positions in connection with the sacred office. Aaron was a type of Christ in his official character as the high priest. His priesthood was a \"shadow of heavenly things,\" and was intended to lead the people of Israel to look forward to the time when \"another priest\" would arise \"after the order of Melchizedek\" ( Hebrews 6:20 ).

( Exodus 7:19 ) etc. On the way to Mount Sinai, during the battle with Amalek, Aaron with Hur stayed up the weary hands of Moses when they were lifted up for the victory of Isr'l. ( Exodus 17:9 ) He is mentioned as dependent upon his brother and deriving all his authority from him. Left, on Moses' departure into Sinai, to guide the people, Aaron is tried for a moment on his own responsibility, and he fails from a weak inability to withstand the demand of the people for visible \"gods to go before them,\" by making an image of Jehovah, in the well-known form of Egyptian idolatry (Apis or Mnevis). He repented of his sin, and Moses gained forgiveness for him. ( 9:20 ) Aaron was not consecrated by Moses to the new office of the high priesthood. ( Exodus 29:9 ) From this time the history of Aaron is almost entirely that of the priesthood, and its chief feature is the great rebellion of Korah and the Levites. Leaning, as he seems to have done, wholly on Moses, it is not strange that he should have shared his sin at Meribah and its punishment. See  MOSES . ( Numbers 20:10-12 ) Aaron's death seems to have followed very speedily. It took place on Mount Hor, after the transference of his robes and office to Eleazar. ( Numbers 20:28 ) This mount is still called the \"Mountain of Aaron.\" See  HOR . The wife of Aaron was Elisheba, ( Exodus 6:23 ) and the two sons who survived him, Eleazar and Ithamar. The high priesthood descended to the former, and to his descendants until the time of Eli, who, although of the house of Ithamar, received the high priesthood and transmitted it to his children; with them it continued till the accession of Solomon, who took it from Abiathar and restored it to Zadok (of the house of Eleazar).

With reference to the valley named after the town, Joshua uttered the celebrated command, \"Sun, stand thou still on Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon\" ( Joshua 10:12 ). It has been identified as the modern Yalo, at the foot of the Beth-horon pass (q.v.). In the Tell Amarna letters Adoni-zedek (q.v.) speaks of the destruction of the \"city of Ajalon\" by the invaders, and describes himself as \"afflicted, greatly afflicted\" by the calamities that had come on the land, urging the king of Egypt to hasten to his help.", "2.

They seem to have originally occupied the land stretching from the heights west of the Dead Sea ( Genesis 14:7 ) to Hebron (Comp.  13:8 ;  Deuteronomy 3:8 ;  4:46-48 ), embracing \"all Gilead and all Bashan\" ( Deuteronomy 3:10 ), with the Jordan valley on the east of the river ( 4:49 ), the land of the \"two kings of the Amorites,\" Sihon and Og ( Deuteronomy 31:4 ;  Joshua 2:10 ;  9:10 ). The five kings of the Amorites were defeated with great slaughter by Joshua ( 10:10 ). They were again defeated at the waters of Merom by Joshua, who smote them till there were none remaining ( Joshua 11:8 ). It is mentioned as a surprising circumstance that in the days of Samuel there was peace between them and the Israelites ( 1 Samuel 7:14 ). The discrepancy supposed to exist between  Deuteronomy 1:44  and  Numbers 14:45  is explained by the circumstance that the terms \"Amorites\" and \"Amalekites\" are used synonymously for the \"Canaanites.\" In the same way we explain the fact that the \"Hivites\" of  Genesis 34:2  are the \"Amorites\" of  48:22 .

It was 100 years in building ( Genesis 5:32 ;  7:6 ). It was intended to preserve certain persons and animals from the deluge which God was about to bring over the earth. It contained eight persons ( Genesis 7:13 ;  2 Peter 2:5 ), and of all \"clean\" animals seven pairs, and of \"unclean\" one pair, and of birds seven pairs of each sort ( Genesis 7:2, 3 ). It was in the form of an oblong square, with flat bottom and sloping roof. Traditions of the Deluge, by which the race of man was swept from the earth, and of the ark of Noah have been found existing among all nations.", "The ark of bulrushes in which the infant Moses was laid ( Exodus 2:3 ) is called in the Hebrew teebah, a word derived from the Egyptian teb, meaning \"a chest.\" It was daubed with slime and with pitch. The bulrushes of which it was made were the papyrus reed.", "The sacred ark is designated by a different Hebrew word, 'aron', which is the common name for a chest or coffer used for any purpose ( Genesis 50:26 ;  2 Kings 12:9, 10 ). It is distinguished from all others by such titles as the \"ark of God\" ( 1 Samuel 3:3 ), \"ark of the covenant\" ( Joshua 3:6 ;  Hebrews 9:4 ), \"ark of the testimony\" ( Exodus 25:22 ). It was made of acacia or shittim wood, a cubit and a half broad and high and two cubits long, and covered all over with the purest gold. Its upper surface or lid, the mercy-seat, was surrounded with a rim of gold; and on each of the two sides were two gold rings, in which were placed two gold-covered poles by which the ark could be carried ( Numbers 7:9 ;  10:21 ;  4:5, 19, 20 ;  1 Kings 8:3, 6 ). Over the ark, at the two extremities, were two cherubim, with their faces turned toward each other ( Leviticus 16:2 ;  Numbers 7:89 ). Their outspread wings over the top of the ark formed the throne of God, while the ark itself was his footstool ( Exodus 25:10-22 ;  37:1-9 ). The ark was deposited in the \"holy of holies,\" and was so placed that one end of the poles by which it was carried touched the veil which separated the two apartments of the tabernacle ( 1 Kings 8:8 ). The two tables of stone which constituted the \"testimony\" or evidence of God's covenant with the people ( Deuteronomy 31:26 ), the \"pot of manna\" ( Exodus 16:33 ), and \"Aaron's rod that budded\" ( Numbers 17:10 ), were laid up in the ark ( Hebrews 9:4 ). (See  TABERNACLE ) The ark and the sanctuary were \"the beauty of Israel\" ( Lamentations 2:1 ). During the journeys of the Israelites the ark was carried by the priests in advance of the host ( Numbers 4:5, 6 ;  10:33-36 ;  Psalms 68:1 ;  132:8 ). It was borne by the priests into the bed of the Jordan, which separated, opening a pathway for the whole of the host to pass over ( Joshua 3:15, 16 ;  4:7, 10, 11, 17, 18 ). It was borne in the procession round Jericho ( Joshua 6:4, 6, 8, 11, 12 ). When carried it was always wrapped in the veil, the badgers' skins, and blue cloth, and carefully concealed even from the eyes of the Levites who carried it. After the settlement of Israel in Palestine the ark remained in the tabernacle at Gilgal for a season, and was then removed to Shiloh till the time of Eli, between 300 and 400 years ( Jeremiah 7:12 ), when it was carried into the field of battle so as to secure, as they supposed, victory to the Hebrews, and was taken by the Philistines ( 1 Samuel 4:3-11 ), who sent it back after retaining it seven months ( 1 Samuel 5:7, 8 ). It remained then at Kirjath-jearim ( 7:1, 2 ) till the time of David (twenty years), who wished to remove it to Jerusalem; but the proper mode of removing it having been neglected, Uzzah was smitten with death for putting \"forth his hand to the ark of God,\" and in consequence of this it was left in the house of Obed-edom in Gath-rimmon for three months ( 2 Samuel 6:1-11 ), at the end of which time David removed it in a grand procession to Jerusalem, where it was kept till a place was prepared for it (12-19). It was afterwards deposited by Solomon in the temple ( 1 Kings 8:6-9) . When the Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem and plundered the temple, the ark was probably taken away by Nebuchadnezzar and destroyed, as no trace of it is afterwards to be found.

It was a hollow square, 5 cubits in length and in breadth, and 3 cubits in height. It was made of shittim wood, and was overlaid with plates of brass. Its corners were ornamented with \"horns\" ( Exodus 29:12 ;  Leviticus 4:18 ).", "In  Exodus 27:3  the various utensils appertaining to the altar are enumerated. They were made of brass. (Comp.  1 Samuel 2:13, 14 ;  Leviticus 16:12 ;  Numbers 16:6, 7 .)", "In Solomon's temple the altar was of larger dimensions ( 2 Chronicles 4:1 . Comp.  1 Kings 8:22, 64 ;  9:25 ), and was made wholly of brass, covering a structure of stone or earth. This altar was renewed by Asa ( 2 Chronicles 15:8 ). It was removed by Ahaz ( 2 Kings 16:14 ), and \"cleansed\" by Hezekiah, in the latter part of whose reign it was rebuilt. It was finally broken up and carried away by the Babylonians ( Jeremiah 52:17 ).", "After the return from captivity it was re-erected ( Ezra 3:3, 6 ) on the same place where it had formerly stood. (Comp. 1 Macc. 4.47.) When Antiochus Epiphanes pillaged Jerusalem the altar of burnt offering was taken away.", "Again the altar was erected by Herod, and remained in its place till the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans ( 70 A.D. ).", "The fire on the altar was not permitted to go out ( Leviticus 6:9 ).", "In the Mosque of Omar, immediately underneath the great dome, which occupies the site of the old temple, there is a rough projection of the natural rock, of about 60 feet in its extreme length, and 50 in its greatest breadth, and in its highest part about 4 feet above the general pavement. This rock seems to have been left intact when Solomon's temple was built. It was in all probability the site of the altar of burnt offering. Underneath this rock is a cave, which may probably have been the granary of Araunah's threshing-floor ( 1 Chronicles 21:22 ).", "2.  The altar of incense ( Exodus 30:1-10 ), called also \"the golden altar\" ( 39:38 ;  Numbers 4:11 ), stood in the holy place \"before the vail that is by the ark of the testimony.\" On this altar sweet spices were continually burned with fire taken from the brazen altar. The morning and the evening services were commenced by the high priest offering incense on this altar. The burning of the incense was a type of prayer ( Psalms 141:2 ;  Revelation 5:8 ;  8:3, 4 ).", "This altar was a small movable table, made of acacia wood overlaid with gold ( Exodus 37:25, 26 ). It was 1 cubit in length and breadth, and 2 cubits in height.", "In Solomon's temple the altar was similar in size, but was made of cedar-wood ( 1 Kings 6:20 ;  7:48 ) overlaid with gold. In  Ezekiel 41:22  it is called \"the altar of wood.\" (Comp.  Exodus 30:1-6. )", "In the temple built after the Exile the altar was restored. Antiochus Epiphanes took it away, but it was afterwards restored by Judas Maccabaeus ( 1 Macc. 1.23; 4.49 ). Among the trophies carried away by Titus on the destruction of Jerusalem the altar of incense is not found, nor is any mention made of it in Hebrews 9. It was at this altar Zacharias ministered when an angel appeared to him ( Luke 1:11 ). It is the only altar which appears in the heavenly temple ( Isaiah 6:6 ;  Revelation 8:3, 4 )."], "Word": "Altar", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "2": {"Definitions": ["Built by:", "Noah Genesis 8:20", "Abraham Genesis 12:7-8 ;  Genesis 13:18 ;  Genesis 22:9", "Isaac Genesis 26:25", "Jacob Genesis 33:20 ;  Genesis 35:1-7", "Moses Exodus 17:15 ;  Exodus 24:4", "Balaam Numbers 23:1 ;  Numbers 23:14 ;  Numbers 23:29", "Joshua Deuteronomy 27:4-7 ;  Joshua 8:30-32", "Reubenites and Gadites Joshua 22:10 ;  Joshua 22:34", "Gideon Judges 6:26-27", "Samuel 1 Samuel 7:17", "Saul 1 Samuel 14:35", "David 2 Samuel 24:18-19", "Elijah 1 Kings 18:31-32", "Mosaic commandments prescribing the construction of Exodus 20:24-26 ;  Deuteronomy 27:5-7 ;  Joshua 8:30-31 ;  Ezekiel 43:13", "Used in idolatrous worship Judges 6:25 ;  1 Kings 12:32 ;  1 Kings 16:32 ;  1 Kings 18:26 ;  2 Kings 16:10 ;  2 Kings 23:12 ;  2 Kings 23:15 ;  Isaiah 27:9 ;  Isaiah 65:3 ;  Hosea 8:11 ;  Acts 17:23", "Of burnt offerings:", "Called Brazen Altar Exodus 39:39 ;  1 Kings 8:64", "Called Altar of God Psalms 43:4", "Called Altar of the Lord Malachi 2:13", "In the tabernacle:", "Pattern of Exodus 27:1-8", "Constructed by Bezaleel Exodus 38:1-7 ;  Exodus 37:1", "Location of Exodus 40:6 ;  Exodus 40:29 ;  Ezekiel 8:16 ;  Matthew 23:35", "Furniture of Exodus 27:3-7 ;  Exodus 38:3-7 ;  1 Samuel 2:13-14", "Horns of Exodus 27:2", "Uses of the horns Psalms 118:27", "How sanctified Exodus 29:36-37 ;  Exodus 29:44 ;  Exodus 30:26-28 ;  Exodus 40:10 ;  Leviticus 8:10-11 ;  Leviticus 4:7 ;  Ezekiel 43:18-27 Blood", "Sanctified everything that touched it Exodus 29:37 ;  Exodus 30:29 ;  Matthew 23:18-19", "A place of refuge Exodus 21:14 ;  1 Kings 1:50 ;  1 Kings 2:28", "In Solomon's temple:", "Description of 2 Chronicles 4:1", "Renewed by Asa 2 Chronicles 15:8", "Removed by Ahaz, and one of idolatrous fashion substituted 2 Kings 16:14-17", "Cleansed by Hezekiah 2 Chronicles 29:18-24", "Repaired by Manasseh 2 Chronicles 33:16", "Furniture of, taken to Babylon 2 Kings 25:14", "In second temple Ezra 3:1-6", "Ezekiel's vision of Ezekiel 43:13-27 Tabernacle ;  Temple", "Of incense", "Called Golden Altar Exodus 39:38 ;  Numbers 4:11", "Called Altar of Sweet Incense Leviticus 4:7", "Called Altar Before the Lord Leviticus 16:18", "Pattern of Exodus 30:1-5", "Constructed Exodus 37:25-28", "Location of Exodus 30:6 ;  Exodus 40:5 ;  Exodus 40:26", "A cover made for the censers of Korah Numbers 16:36-40", "Uses of Exodus 30:7-10 ;  Exodus 30:26-27 ;  Exodus 40:27 ;  Leviticus 4:7 ;  Leviticus 4:18 ;  Leviticus 8:15 ;  Leviticus 9:9 ;  Leviticus 16:12 ;  Leviticus 16:18", "How prepared for carrying Numbers 4:4-15", "Carried by the Kohathites Numbers 3:27-31", "In Solomon's temple 1 Kings 6:19-20 ;  1 Kings 7:48 ;  1 Chronicles 28:18", "Seen in John's vision Revelation 8:3 ;  Revelation 9:13"], "Word": "Altar", "Dictionary": "Naves Topical Index"}, "3": {"Definitions": ["The first altar of which we have any account is that built by Noah when he left the ark. ( Genesis 8:20 ) In the early times altars were usually built in certain spots hallowed by religious associations, e.g., where God appeared. ( Genesis 12:7 ;  13:18 ;  26:25 ;  35:1 ) Though generally erected for the offering of sacrifice, in some instances they appear to have been only memorials. ( Genesis 12:7 ;  Exodus 17:15,16 ) Altars were most probably originally made of earth. The law of Moses allowed them to be made of either earth or unhewn stones. ( Exodus 20:24,25 ) I.  The Altar of Burnt Offering  . It differed in construction at different times. (1) In the tabernacle, ( Exodus 27:1 ) ff.;  Exod 38:1  ff., it was comparatively small and portable. In shape it was square. It as five cubits in length, the same in breadth, and three cubits high. It was made of planks of shittim (or acacia) wood overlaid with brass. The interior was hollow. ( Exodus 27:8 ) At the four corners were four projections called horns made, like the altar itself, of shittim wood overlaid with brass, ( Exodus 27:2 ) and to them the victim was bound when about to be sacrificed. ( Psalms 118:27 ) Round the altar, midway between the top and bottom, ran a projecting ledge, on which perhaps the priest stood when officiating. To the outer edge of this, again, a grating or network of brass was affixed, and reached to the bottom of the altar. At the four corners of the network were four brazen rings, into which were inserted the staves by which the altar was carried. These staves were of the same material as the altar itself. As the priests were forbidden to ascend the altar by steps, ( Exodus 20:26 ) it has been conjectured that a slope of earth led gradually up to the ledge from which they officiated. The place of the altar was at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.)\" ( Exodus 40:29 ) (2) In Solomon's temple the altar was considerably larger in its dimensions. It differed too in the material of which it was made, being entirely of brass. ( 1 Kings 8:64 ;  2 Chronicles 7:7 ) It had no grating, and instead of a single gradual slope, the ascent to it was probably made by three successive platforms, to each of which it has been supposed that steps led. The altar erected by Herod in front of the temple was 15 cubits in height and 50 cubits in length and breadth. According to ( Leviticus 6:12,13 ) a perpetual fire was to be kept burning on the altar. II.  The Altar of Incense  , called also the golden altar to distinguish it from the altar of burnt offering which was called the  brazen  altar. ( Exodus 38:30 ) (a) That in the tabernacle was made of acacia wood, overlaid with pure gold. In shape it was square, being a cubit in length and breadth and two cubits in height. Like the altar of burnt offering it had horns at the four corners, which were of one piece with the rest of the altar. This altar stood in the holy place, \"before the vail that is by the ark of the testimony.\" ( Exodus 30:6 ;  40:5 ) (b) The altar of Solomon's temple was similar, ( 1 Kings 7:48 ;  1 Chronicles 28:18 ) but was made of cedar overlaid with gold. III.  Other Altars  . In ( Acts 17:23 ) reference is made to an alter to an unknown God. There were several altars in Athens with this inscription, erected during the time of a plague.

It was a mountainous region lying to the north of Babylonia, extending along the Tigris as far as to the high mountain range of Armenia, the Gordiaean or Carduchian mountains. It was founded in B.C. 1700 under Bel-kap-kapu, and became an independent and a conquering power, and shook off the yoke of its Babylonian masters. It subdued the whole of Northern Asia. The Assyrians were Semites ( Genesis 10:22 ), but in process of time non-Semite tribes mingled with the inhabitants. They were a military people, the \"Romans of the East.\"", "Of the early history of the kingdom of Assyria little is positively known. In B.C. 1120 Tiglath-pileser I., the greatest of the Assyrian kings, \"crossed the Euphrates, defeated the kings of the Hittites, captured the city of Carchemish, and advanced as far as the shores of the Mediterranean.\" He may be regarded as the founder of the first Assyrian empire. After this the Assyrians gradually extended their power, subjugating the states of Northern Syria. In the reign of Ahab, king of Israel, Shalmaneser II. marched an army against the Syrian states, whose allied army he encountered and vanquished at Karkar. This led to Ahab's casting off the yoke of Damascus and allying himself with Judah. Some years after this the Assyrian king marched an army against Hazael, king of Damascus. He besieged and took that city. He also brought under tribute Jehu, and the cities of Tyre and Sidon.", "About a hundred years after this (B.C. 745) the crown was seized by a military adventurer called Pul, who assumed the name of Tiglath-pileser III. He directed his armies into Syria, which had by this time regained its independence, and took (B.C. 740) Arpad, near Aleppo, after a siege of three years, and reduced Hamath. Azariah (Uzziah) was an ally of the king of Hamath, and thus was compelled by Tiglath-pileser to do him homage and pay a yearly tribute.", "In B.C. 738, in the reign of Menahem, king of Israel, Pul invaded Israel, and imposed on it a heavy tribute ( 2 Kings 15:19 ). Ahaz, the king of Judah, when engaged in a war against Israel and Syria, appealed for help to this Assyrian king by means of a present of gold and silver ( 2 Kings 16:8 ); who accordingly \"marched against Damascus, defeated and put Rezin to death, and besieged the city itself.\" Leaving a portion of his army to continue the siege, \"he advanced through the province east of Jordan, spreading fire and sword,\" and became master of Philistia, and took Samaria and Damascus. He died B.C. 727, and was succeeded by Shalmanezer IV., who ruled till B.C. 722. He also invaded Syria ( 2 Kings 17:5 ), but was deposed in favour of Sargon (q.v.) the Tartan, or commander-in-chief of the army, who took Samaria (q.v.) after a siege of three years, and so put an end to the kingdom of Israel, carrying the people away into captivity, B.C. 722 ( 2 Kings 17:1-6, 24 ;  18:7, 9 ). He also overran the land of Judah, and took the city of Jerusalem ( Isaiah 10:6, 12, 22, 24, 34 ). Mention is next made of Sennacherib (B.C. 705), the son and successor of Sargon ( 2 Kings 18:13 ;  19:37 ;  Isaiah 7:17, 18 ); and then of Esar-haddon, his son and successor, who took Manasseh, king of Judah, captive, and kept him for some time a prisoner at Babylon, which he alone of all the Assyrian kings made the seat of his government ( 2 Kings 19:37 ;  Isaiah 37:38 ).", "Assur-bani-pal, the son of Esarhaddon, became king, and in  Ezra 4:10  is referred to as Asnapper. From an early period Assyria had entered on a conquering career, and having absorbed Babylon, the kingdoms of Hamath, Damascus, and Samaria, it conquered Phoenicia, and made Judea feudatory, and subjected Philistia and Idumea. At length, however, its power declined. In B.C. 727 the Babylonians threw off the rule of the Assyrians, under the leadership of the powerful Chaldean prince Merodach-baladan ( 2 Kings 20:12 ), who, after twelve years, was subdued by Sargon, who now reunited the kingdom, and ruled over a vast empire. But on his death the smouldering flames of rebellion again burst forth, and the Babylonians and Medes successfully asserted their independence (B.C. 625), and Assyria fell according to the prophecies of Isaiah ( 10:5-19 ), Nahum ( 3:19 ), and Zephaniah ( 3:13 ), and the many separate kingdoms of which it was composed ceased to recognize the \"great king\" ( 2 Kings 18:19 ;  Isaiah 36:4 ). Ezekiel (31) attests (about B.C. 586) how completely Assyria was overthrown. It ceases to be a nation.

Both of these tribes hired Balaam to curse Israel ( Deuteronomy 23:4 ). The Ammonites were probably more of a predatory tribe, moving from place to place, while the Moabites were more settled. They inhabited the country east of the Jordan and north of Moab and the Dead Sea, from which they had expelled the Zamzummims or Zuzims ( Deuteronomy 2:20 ;  Genesis 14:5 ). They are known as the Beni-ammi ( Genesis 19:38 ), Ammi or Ammon being worshipped as their chief god. They were of Semitic origin, and closely related to the Hebrews in blood and language. They showed no kindness to the Israelites when passing through their territory, and therefore they were prohibited from \"entering the congregation of the Lord to the tenth generation\" ( Deuteronomy 23:3 ). They afterwards became hostile to Israel ( Judges 3:13 ). Jephthah waged war against them, and \"took twenty cities with a very great slaughter\" ( Judges 11:33 ). They were again signally defeated by Saul ( 1 Samuel 11:11 ). David also defeated them and their allies the Syrians ( 2 Samuel 10:6-14 ), and took their chief city, Rabbah, with much spoil ( 2 Samuel 10:14 ;  12:26-31 ). The subsequent events of their history are noted in  2 Chronicles 20:25 ;  26:8 ;  Jeremiah 49:1 ;  Ezekiel 25:3, 6 . One of Solomon's wives was Naamah, an Ammonite.

From the time of their entering the land of Canaan to the time of the kings, the Israelites made little progress in military affairs, although often engaged in warfare.

At the Exodus the number of males above twenty years capable of bearing arms was 600,000 ( Exodus 12:37 ).

Each tribe formed a battalion, with its own banner and leader ( Numbers 2:2 ;  10:14 ). In war the army was divided into thousands and hundreds under their several captains ( Numbers 31:14 ), and also into families ( Numbers 2:34 ;  2 Chronicles 25:5 ;  26:12 ). From the time of their entering the land of Canaan to the time of the kings, the Israelites made little progress in military affairs, although often engaged in warfare. The kings introduced the custom of maintaining a bodyguard (the Gibborim; i.e., \"heroes\"), and thus the nucleus of a standing army was formed. Saul had an army of 3,000 select warriors ( 1 Samuel 13:2 ;  14:52 ;  24:2 ). David also had a band of soldiers around him ( 1 Samuel 23:13 ;  25:13 ). To this band he afterwards added the Cherethites and the Pelethites ( 2 Samuel 15:18 ;  20:7 ). At first the army consisted only of infantry ( 1 Samuel 4:10 ;  15:4 ), as the use of horses was prohibited ( Deuteronomy 17:16 ); but chariots and horses were afterwards added ( 2 Samuel 8:4 ;  1 Kings 10:26, 28, 29 ;  1 Kings 9:19 ). In  1 Kings 9:22  there is given a list of the various gradations of rank held by those who composed the army. The equipment and maintenance of the army were at the public expense ( 2 Samuel 17:28, 29 ;  1 Kings 4:27 ;  10:16, 17 ;  Judges 20:10 ). At the Exodus the number of males above twenty years capable of bearing arms was 600,000 ( Exodus 12:37 ). In David's time it mounted to the number of 1,300,000 ( 2 Samuel 24:9 )."], "Word": "Army", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "3": {"Definitions": ["I.

( Exodus 13:18 ) On the approach of an enemy a conscription was made from the general body, under the direction of a muster-master, ( 20:5 ;  2 Kings 25:19 ) by whom also the officers were appointed. ( 20:9 ) The army had then divided into thousands and hundreds under their respective captains, ( Numbers 31:14 ) and still further into families. ( Numbers 2:34 ;  2 Chronicles 25:5 ;  26:12 ) With the king arose the custom of maintaining a body-guard, which formed the nucleus of a standing army, and David's band of 600, ( 1 Samuel 23:13 ;  25:13 ) he retained after he became king, and added the CHERETHITES and PELETHITES. ( 2 Samuel 15:18 ;  20:7 ) David further organized a national militia, divided into twelve regiments under their respective officers, each of which was called out for one month in the year. ( 1 Chronicles 27:1 ) ... It does not appear that the system established by David was maintained by the kings of Judah; but in Isr'l the proximity of the hostile kingdom of Syria necessitated the maintenance of a standing army. The maintenance and equipment of the soldiers at the public expense dated from the establishment of a standing army. It is doubtful whether the soldier ever received pay even under the kings. II. ROMAN EMPIRE ARMY.", "The Roman army was divided into legions, the number of which varied considerably (from 3000 to 6000), each under six tribuni (\"chief captains,\") ( Acts 21:31 ) who commanded by turns. The legion was subdivided into ten cohorts (\"band,\") ( Acts 10:1 ) the cohort into three maniples, and the maniple into two centuries, containing originally 100 men, as the name implies, but subsequently from 50 to 100 men, according to the strength of the legion. There were thus 60 centuries in a legion, each under the command of a centurion. ( Acts 10:1,22 ;  Matthew 8:5 ;  27:54 ) In addition to the legionary cohorts, independent cohorts of volunteers served under the Roman standards.

The act of anointing was significant of consecration to a holy or sacred use; hence the anointing of the high priest ( Exodus 29:29 ;  Leviticus 4:3 ) and of the sacred vessels ( Exodus 30:26 ). The high priest and the king are thus called \"the anointed\" ( Leviticus 4:3, 5, 16 ;  6:20 ;  Psalms 132:10 ). Anointing a king was equivalent to crowning him ( 1 Samuel 16:13 ;  2 Samuel 2:4 , etc.). Prophets were also anointed ( 1 Kings 19:16 ;  1 Chronicles 16:22 ;  Psalms 105:15 ).

Anointing was also an act of hospitality ( Luke 7:38, 46 ).

The offensive weapons were different at different periods of history. The \"rod of iron\" ( Psalms 2:9 ) is supposed to mean a mace or crowbar, an instrument of great power when used by a strong arm. The \"maul\" ( Proverbs 25:18 ; cognate Hebrew word rendered \"battle-axe\" in  Jeremiah 51:20 , and \"slaughter weapon\" in  Ezekiel 9:2 ) was a war-hammer or martel. The \"sword\" is the usual translation of hereb, which properly means \"poniard.\" The real sword, as well as the dirk-sword (which was always double-edged), was also used ( 1 Samuel 17:39 ;  2 Samuel 20:8 ;  1 Kings 20:11 ). The spear was another offensive weapon ( Joshua 8:18 ;  1 Samuel 17:7 ). The javelin was used by light troops ( Numbers 25:7, 8 ;  1 Samuel 13:22 ). Saul threw a javelin at David ( 1 Samuel 19:9, 10 ), and so virtually absolved him from his allegiance. The bow was, however, the chief weapon of offence. The arrows were carried in a quiver, the bow being always unbent till the moment of action ( Genesis 27:3 ;  48:22 ;  Psalms 18:34 ). The sling was a favourite weapon of the Benjamites ( 1 Samuel 17:40 ;  1 Chronicles 12:2 . Comp.  1 Samuel 25:29 ).", "2.  Of the defensive armour a chief place is assigned to the shield or buckler. There were the great shield or target (the tzinnah), for the protection of the whole person ( Genesis 15:1 ;  Psalms 47:9 ;  1 Samuel 17:7 ;  Proverbs 30:5 ), and the buckler (Heb. mageen) or small shield ( 1 Kings 10:17 ;  Ezekiel 26:8 ). In  Psalms 91:4  \"buckler\" is properly a roundel appropriated to archers or slingers. The helmet ( Ezekiel 27:10 ;  1 Samuel 17:38 ), a covering for the head; the coat of mail or corselet ( 1 Samuel 17:5 ), or habergeon ( Nehemiah 4:16 ), harness or breat-plate ( Revelation 9:9 ), for the covering of the back and breast and both upper arms ( Isaiah 59:17 ;  Ephesians 6:14 ).

In the Old Testament it is of frequent occurrence.", "The meaning of the word is simply at-one-ment, i.e., the state of being at one or being reconciled, so that atonement is reconciliation. Thus it is used to denote the effect which flows from the death of Christ.", "But the word is also used to denote that by which this reconciliation is brought about, viz., the death of Christ itself; and when so used it means satisfaction, and in this sense to make an atonement for one is to make satisfaction for his offences ( Exodus 32:30 ;  Leviticus 4:26 ;  5:16 ;  Numbers 6:11 ), and, as regards the person, to reconcile, to propitiate God in his behalf.", "By the atonement of Christ we generally mean his work by which he expiated our sins. But in Scripture usage the word denotes the reconciliation itself, and not the means by which it is effected. When speaking of Christ's saving work, the word \"satisfaction,\" the word used by the theologians of the Reformation, is to be preferred to the word \"atonement.\" Christ's satisfaction is all he did in the room and in behalf of sinners to satisfy the demands of the law and justice of God. Christ's work consisted of suffering and obedience, and these were vicarious, i.e., were not merely for our benefit, but were in our stead, as the suffering and obedience of our vicar, or substitute. Our guilt is expiated by the punishment which our vicar bore, and thus God is rendered propitious, i.e., it is now consistent with his justice to manifest his love to transgressors. Expiation has been made for sin, i.e., it is covered. The means by which it is covered is vicarious satisfaction, and the result of its being covered is atonement or reconciliation. To make atonement is to do that by virtue of which alienation ceases and reconciliation is brought about. Christ's mediatorial work and sufferings are the ground or efficient cause of reconciliation with God. They rectify the disturbed relations between God and man, taking away the obstacles interposed by sin to their fellowship and concord. The reconciliation is mutual, i.e., it is not only that of sinners toward God, but also and pre-eminently that of God toward sinners, effected by the sin-offering he himself provided, so that consistently with the other attributes of his character his love might flow forth in all its fulness of blessing to men. The primary idea presented to us in different forms throughout the Scripture is that the death of Christ is a satisfaction of infinite worth rendered to the law and justice of God (q.v.), and accepted by him in room of the very penalty man had incurred.

In the Old Testament it is of frequent occurrence.", "The meaning of the word is simply at-one-ment, i.e., the state of being at one or being reconciled, so that atonement is reconciliation. Thus it is used to denote the effect which flows from the death of Christ.", "But the word is also used to denote that by which this reconciliation is brought about, viz., the death of Christ itself; and when so used it means satisfaction, and in this sense to make an atonement for one is to make satisfaction for his offences ( Exodus 32:30 ;  Leviticus 4:26 ;  5:16 ;  Numbers 6:11 ), and, as regards the person, to reconcile, to propitiate God in his behalf.", "By the atonement of Christ we generally mean his work by which he expiated our sins. But in Scripture usage the word denotes the reconciliation itself, and not the means by which it is effected. When speaking of Christ's saving work, the word \"satisfaction,\" the word used by the theologians of the Reformation, is to be preferred to the word \"atonement.\" Christ's satisfaction is all he did in the room and in behalf of sinners to satisfy the demands of the law and justice of God. Christ's work consisted of suffering and obedience, and these were vicarious, i.e., were not merely for our benefit, but were in our stead, as the suffering and obedience of our vicar, or substitute. Our guilt is expiated by the punishment which our vicar bore, and thus God is rendered propitious, i.e., it is now consistent with his justice to manifest his love to transgressors. Expiation has been made for sin, i.e., it is covered. The means by which it is covered is vicarious satisfaction, and the result of its being covered is atonement or reconciliation. To make atonement is to do that by virtue of which alienation ceases and reconciliation is brought about. Christ's mediatorial work and sufferings are the ground or efficient cause of reconciliation with God. They rectify the disturbed relations between God and man, taking away the obstacles interposed by sin to their fellowship and concord. The reconciliation is mutual, i.e., it is not only that of sinners toward God, but also and pre-eminently that of God toward sinners, effected by the sin-offering he himself provided, so that consistently with the other attributes of his character his love might flow forth in all its fulness of blessing to men. The primary idea presented to us in different forms throughout the Scripture is that the death of Christ is a satisfaction of infinite worth rendered to the law and justice of God (q.v.), and accepted by him in room of the very penalty man had incurred. It must also be constantly kept in mind that the atonement is not the cause but the consequence of God's love to guilty men ( John 3:16 ;  Romans 3:24, 25 ;  Ephesians 1:7 ;  1 John 1:9 ;  4:9 ). The atonement may also be regarded as necessary, not in an absolute but in a relative sense, i.e., if man is to be saved, there is no other way than this which God has devised and carried out ( Exodus 34:7 ;  Joshua 24:19 ;  Psalms 5:4 ;  7:11 ;  Nahum 1:2, 6 ;  Romans 3:5 ).

Its corners were ornamented with \"horns\" ( Exodus 29:12 ;  Leviticus 4:18 ).", "In  Exodus 27:3  the various utensils appertaining to the altar are enumerated. They were made of brass. (Comp.  1 Samuel 2:13, 14 ;  Leviticus 16:12 ;  Numbers 16:6, 7 .)", "In Solomon's temple the altar was of larger dimensions ( 2 Chronicles 4:1 . Comp.  1 Kings 8:22, 64 ;  9:25 ), and was made wholly of brass, covering a structure of stone or earth. This altar was renewed by Asa ( 2 Chronicles 15:8 ). It was removed by Ahaz ( 2 Kings 16:14 ), and \"cleansed\" by Hezekiah, in the latter part of whose reign it was rebuilt. It was finally broken up and carried away by the Babylonians ( Jeremiah 52:17 ).", "After the return from captivity it was re-erected ( Ezra 3:3, 6 ) on the same place where it had formerly stood. (Comp. 1 Macc. 4.47.) When Antiochus Epiphanes pillaged Jerusalem the altar of burnt offering was taken away.", "Again the altar was erected by Herod, and remained in its place till the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans ( 70 A.D. ).", "The fire on the altar was not permitted to go out ( Leviticus 6:9 ).", "In the Mosque of Omar, immediately underneath the great dome, which occupies the site of the old temple, there is a rough projection of the natural rock, of about 60 feet in its extreme length, and 50 in its greatest breadth, and in its highest part about 4 feet above the general pavement. This rock seems to have been left intact when Solomon's temple was built. It was in all probability the site of the altar of burnt offering. Underneath this rock is a cave, which may probably have been the granary of Araunah's threshing-floor ( 1 Chronicles 21:22 ).", "2.  The altar of incense ( Exodus 30:1-10 ), called also \"the golden altar\" ( 39:38 ;  Numbers 4:11 ), stood in the holy place \"before the vail that is by the ark of the testimony.\" On this altar sweet spices were continually burned with fire taken from the brazen altar. The morning and the evening services were commenced by the high priest offering incense on this altar. The burning of the incense was a type of prayer ( Psalms 141:2 ;  Revelation 5:8 ;  8:3, 4 ).", "This altar was a small movable table, made of acacia wood overlaid with gold ( Exodus 37:25, 26 ). It was 1 cubit in length and breadth, and 2 cubits in height.", "In Solomon's temple the altar was similar in size, but was made of cedar-wood ( 1 Kings 6:20 ;  7:48 ) overlaid with gold. In  Ezekiel 41:22  it is called \"the altar of wood.\" (Comp.  Exodus 30:1-6. )", "In the temple built after the Exile the altar was restored. Antiochus Epiphanes took it away, but it was afterwards restored by Judas Maccabaeus ( 1 Macc. 1.23; 4.49 ). Among the trophies carried away by Titus on the destruction of Jerusalem the altar of incense is not found, nor is any mention made of it in Hebrews 9. It was at this altar Zacharias ministered when an angel appeared to him ( Luke 1:11 ). It is the only altar which appears in the heavenly temple ( Isaiah 6:6 ;  Revelation 8:3, 4 )."], "Word": "Altar", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "2": {"Definitions": ["Built by:", "Noah Genesis 8:20", "Abraham Genesis 12:7-8 ;  Genesis 13:18 ;  Genesis 22:9", "Isaac Genesis 26:25", "Jacob Genesis 33:20 ;  Genesis 35:1-7", "Moses Exodus 17:15 ;  Exodus 24:4", "Balaam Numbers 23:1 ;  Numbers 23:14 ;  Numbers 23:29", "Joshua Deuteronomy 27:4-7 ;  Joshua 8:30-32", "Reubenites and Gadites Joshua 22:10 ;  Joshua 22:34", "Gideon Judges 6:26-27", "Samuel 1 Samuel 7:17", "Saul 1 Samuel 14:35", "David 2 Samuel 24:18-19", "Elijah 1 Kings 18:31-32", "Mosaic commandments prescribing the construction of Exodus 20:24-26 ;  Deuteronomy 27:5-7 ;  Joshua 8:30-31 ;  Ezekiel 43:13", "Used in idolatrous worship Judges 6:25 ;  1 Kings 12:32 ;  1 Kings 16:32 ;  1 Kings 18:26 ;  2 Kings 16:10 ;  2 Kings 23:12 ;  2 Kings 23:15 ;  Isaiah 27:9 ;  Isaiah 65:3 ;  Hosea 8:11 ;  Acts 17:23", "Of burnt offerings:", "Called Brazen Altar Exodus 39:39 ;  1 Kings 8:64", "Called Altar of God Psalms 43:4", "Called Altar of the Lord Malachi 2:13", "In the tabernacle:", "Pattern of Exodus 27:1-8", "Constructed by Bezaleel Exodus 38:1-7 ;  Exodus 37:1", "Location of Exodus 40:6 ;  Exodus 40:29 ;  Ezekiel 8:16 ;  Matthew 23:35", "Furniture of Exodus 27:3-7 ;  Exodus 38:3-7 ;  1 Samuel 2:13-14", "Horns of Exodus 27:2", "Uses of the horns Psalms 118:27", "How sanctified Exodus 29:36-37 ;  Exodus 29:44 ;  Exodus 30:26-28 ;  Exodus 40:10 ;  Leviticus 8:10-11 ;  Leviticus 4:7 ;  Ezekiel 43:18-27 Blood", "Sanctified everything that touched it Exodus 29:37 ;  Exodus 30:29 ;  Matthew 23:18-19", "A place of refuge Exodus 21:14 ;  1 Kings 1:50 ;  1 Kings 2:28", "In Solomon's temple:", "Description of 2 Chronicles 4:1", "Renewed by Asa 2 Chronicles 15:8", "Removed by Ahaz, and one of idolatrous fashion substituted 2 Kings 16:14-17", "Cleansed by Hezekiah 2 Chronicles 29:18-24", "Repaired by Manasseh 2 Chronicles 33:16", "Furniture of, taken to Babylon 2 Kings 25:14", "In second temple Ezra 3:1-6", "Ezekiel's vision of Ezekiel 43:13-27 Tabernacle ;  Temple", "Of incense", "Called Golden Altar Exodus 39:38 ;  Numbers 4:11", "Called Altar of Sweet Incense Leviticus 4:7", "Called Altar Before the Lord Leviticus 16:18", "Pattern of Exodus 30:1-5", "Constructed Exodus 37:25-28", "Location of Exodus 30:6 ;  Exodus 40:5 ;  Exodus 40:26", "A cover made for the censers of Korah Numbers 16:36-40", "Uses of Exodus 30:7-10 ;  Exodus 30:26-27 ;  Exodus 40:27 ;  Leviticus 4:7 ;  Leviticus 4:18 ;  Leviticus 8:15 ;  Leviticus 9:9 ;  Leviticus 16:12 ;  Leviticus 16:18", "How prepared for carrying Numbers 4:4-15", "Carried by the Kohathites Numbers 3:27-31", "In Solomon's temple 1 Kings 6:19-20 ;  1 Kings 7:48 ;  1 Chronicles 28:18", "Seen in John's vision Revelation 8:3 ;  Revelation 9:13"], "Word": "Altar", "Dictionary": "Naves Topical Index"}, "3": {"Definitions": ["The first altar of which we have any account is that built by Noah when he left the ark. ( Genesis 8:20 ) In the early times altars were usually built in certain spots hallowed by religious associations, e.g., where God appeared. ( Genesis 12:7 ;  13:18 ;  26:25 ;  35:1 ) Though generally erected for the offering of sacrifice, in some instances they appear to have been only memorials. ( Genesis 12:7 ;  Exodus 17:15,16 ) Altars were most probably originally made of earth. The law of Moses allowed them to be made of either earth or unhewn stones. ( Exodus 20:24,25 ) I.  The Altar of Burnt Offering  . It differed in construction at different times. (1) In the tabernacle, ( Exodus 27:1 ) ff.;  Exod 38:1  ff., it was comparatively small and portable. In shape it was square. It as five cubits in length, the same in breadth, and three cubits high. It was made of planks of shittim (or acacia) wood overlaid with brass. The interior was hollow. ( Exodus 27:8 ) At the four corners were four projections called horns made, like the altar itself, of shittim wood overlaid with brass, ( Exodus 27:2 ) and to them the victim was bound when about to be sacrificed. ( Psalms 118:27 ) Round the altar, midway between the top and bottom, ran a projecting ledge, on which perhaps the priest stood when officiating. To the outer edge of this, again, a grating or network of brass was affixed, and reached to the bottom of the altar. At the four corners of the network were four brazen rings, into which were inserted the staves by which the altar was carried. These staves were of the same material as the altar itself. As the priests were forbidden to ascend the altar by steps, ( Exodus 20:26 ) it has been conjectured that a slope of earth led gradually up to the ledge from which they officiated. The place of the altar was at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.)\" ( Exodus 40:29 ) (2) In Solomon's temple the altar was considerably larger in its dimensions. It differed too in the material of which it was made, being entirely of brass. ( 1 Kings 8:64 ;  2 Chronicles 7:7 ) It had no grating, and instead of a single gradual slope, the ascent to it was probably made by three successive platforms, to each of which it has been supposed that steps led. The altar erected by Herod in front of the temple was 15 cubits in height and 50 cubits in length and breadth. According to ( Leviticus 6:12,13 ) a perpetual fire was to be kept burning on the altar. II.  The Altar of Incense  , called also the golden altar to distinguish it from the altar of burnt offering which was called the  brazen  altar. ( Exodus 38:30 ) (a) That in the tabernacle was made of acacia wood, overlaid with pure gold. In shape it was square, being a cubit in length and breadth and two cubits in height. Like the altar of burnt offering it had horns at the four corners, which were of one piece with the rest of the altar. This altar stood in the holy place, \"before the vail that is by the ark of the testimony.\" ( Exodus 30:6 ;  40:5 ) (b) The altar of Solomon's temple was similar, ( 1 Kings 7:48 ;  1 Chronicles 28:18 ) but was made of cedar overlaid with gold. III.  Other Altars  . In ( Acts 17:23 ) reference is made to an alter to an unknown God. There were several altars in Athens with this inscription, erected during the time of a plague.

The name does not denote their nature but their office as messengers. The appearances to Abraham at Mamre ( Genesis 18:2, 22 . Comp.  19:1 ), to Jacob at Peniel ( Genesis 32:24, 30 ), to Joshua at Gilgal ( Joshua 5:13, 15 ), of the Angel of the Lord, were doubtless manifestations of the Divine presence, \"foreshadowings of the incarnation,\" revelations before the \"fulness of the time\" of the Son of God.", "1.  The existence and orders of angelic beings can only be discovered from the Scriptures. Although the Bible does not treat of this subject specially, yet there are numerous incidental details that furnish us with ample information. Their personal existence is plainly implied in such passages as  Genesis 16:7, 10, 11 ;  Judges 13:1-21 ;  Matthew 28:2-5;   Hebrews 1:4 , etc.", "These superior beings are very numerous. \"Thousand thousands,\" etc. ( Daniel 7:10 ;  Matthew 26:53 ;  Luke 2:13 ;  Hebrews 12:22, 23 ). They are also spoken of as of different ranks in dignity and power ( Zechariah 1:9, 11 ;  Daniel 10:13 ;  12:1 ;  1 Thessalonians 4:16 ;  Jude 1:9 ;  Ephesians 1:21 ;  Colossians 1:16 ).", "2.  As to their nature, they are spirits ( Hebrews 1:14 ), like the soul of man, but not incorporeal. Such expressions as \"like the angels\" ( Luke 20:36 ), and the fact that whenever angels appeared to man it was always in a human form ( Genesis 18:2 ;  19:1, 10 ;  Luke 24:4 ;  Acts 1:10 ), and the titles that are applied to them (\"sons of God,\"  Job 1:6 ;  38:7 ;  Daniel 3:25 ; comp. 28) and to men ( Luke 3:38 ), seem all to indicate some resemblance between them and the human race. Imperfection is ascribed to them as creatures ( Job 4:18 ;  Matthew 24:36 ;  1 Peter 1:12 ). As finite creatures they may fall under temptation; and accordingly we read of \"fallen angels.\" Of the cause and manner of their \"fall\" we are wholly ignorant. We know only that \"they left their first estate\" ( Matthew 25:41 ;  Revelation 12:7, 9 ), and that they are \"reserved unto judgement\" ( 2 Peter 2:4 ). When the manna is called \"angels' food,\" this is merely to denote its excellence ( Psalms 78:25 ). Angels never die ( Luke 20:36 ). They are possessed of superhuman intelligence and power ( Mark 13:32 ;  2 Thessalonians 1:7 ;  Psalms 103:20 ). They are called \"holy\" ( Luke 9:26 ), \"elect\" ( 1 Timothy 5:21 ). The redeemed in glory are \"like unto the angels\" ( Luke 20:36 ). They are not to be worshipped ( Colossians 2:18 ;  Revelation 19:10 ).", "3.  Their functions are manifold. (a) In the widest sense they are agents of God's providence ( Exodus 12:23 ;  Psalms 104:4 ;  Hebrews 11:28 ;  1 Corinthians 10:10 ;  2 Samuel 24:16 ;  1 Chronicles 21:16 ;  2 Kings 19:35 ;  Acts 12:23 ). (b) They are specially God's agents in carrying on his great work of redemption. There is no notice of angelic appearances to man till after the call of Abraham. From that time onward there are frequent references to their ministry on earth ( Genesis 18 ;  19 ;  24:7, 40 ;  28:12 ;  32:1 ). They appear to rebuke idolatry ( Judges 2:1-4) , to call Gideon ( Judges 6:11, 12 ), and to consecrate Samson ( 13:3 ). In the days of the prophets, from Samuel downward, the angels appear only in their behalf ( 1 Kings 19:5 ;  2 Kings 6:17 ;  Zechariah 1-6 ;  Daniel 4:13, 23 ;  10:10, 13, 20, 21 ).", "The Incarnation introduces a new era in the ministrations of angels. They come with their Lord to earth to do him service while here. They predict his advent ( Matthew 1:20 ;  Luke 1:26-38 ), minister to him after his temptation and agony ( Matthew 4:11 ;  Luke 22:43 ), and declare his resurrection and ascension ( Matthew 28:2-8;   John 20:12, 13 ;  Acts 1:10, 11 ). They are now ministering spirits to the people of God ( Hebrews 1:14 ;  Psalms 34:7 ;  91:11 ;  Matthew 18:10 ;  Acts 5:19 ;  8:26 ;  10:3 ;  12:7 ;  27:23 ). They rejoice over a penitent sinner ( Luke 15:10 ). They bear the souls of the redeemed to paradise ( Luke 16:22 ); and they will be the ministers of judgement hereafter on the great day ( Matthew 13:39, 41, 49 ;  16:27 ;  24:31 ). The passages ( Psalms 34:7 ,  Matthew 18:10 ) usually referred to in support of the idea that every individual has a particular guardian angel have no such meaning. They merely indicate that God employs the ministry of angels to deliver his people from affliction and danger, and that the angels do not think it below their dignity to minister even to children and to the least among Christ's disciples.", "The \"angel of his presence\" ( Isaiah 63:9 . Comp.  Exodus 23:20, 21 ;  32:34 ;  33:2 ;  Numbers 20:16 ) is probably rightly interpreted of the Messiah as the guide of his people.

They afterwards attacked the Israelites at Hormah ( Numbers 14:45 ). We read of them subsequently as in league with the Moabites ( Judges 3:13 ) and the Midianites ( Judges 6:3 ). Saul finally desolated their territory and destroyed their power ( 1 Samuel 14:48 ;  15:3 ), and David recovered booty from them ( 1 Samuel 30:18-20 ). In the Babylonian inscriptions they are called Sute, in those of Egypt Sittiu, and the Amarna tablets include them under the general name of Khabbati, or \"plunderers.\""], "Word": "Amalekite", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "6": {"Definitions": ["A people inhabiting the country south of Idumea and east of the Red Sea Numbers 13:29 ;  Numbers 14:25 ;  1 Samuel 15:7 ;  1 Samuel 27:8", "Defeated by:", "Chedorlaomer Genesis 14:7", "Joshua Exodus 17:8 ;  Exodus 17:13", "Gideon Jude 1:7", "Saul 1 Samuel 14:47-48 ;  1 Samuel 15:1-33", "David 1 Samuel 27:8-9 ;  1 Samuel 30:1-20", "The Simeonites 1 Chronicles 4:42-43", "Defeat the Israelites Numbers 14:45 ;  Judges 3:13", "Israel commanded to destroy Deuteronomy 25:17-19 ;  1 Samuel 28:18", "Prophecies against Exodus 17:14 ;  Exodus 17:16 ;  Numbers 24:20"], "Word": "Amalekites", "Dictionary": "Naves Topical Index"}, "7": {"Definitions": ["a nomadic tribe of uncertain origin, which occupied the peninsula of Sinai and the wilderness intervening between the southern hill-ranges of Palestine and the border of Egypt.

In form, blossoms, and fruit it resembles the peach tree. Its blossoms are of a very pale pink colour, and appear before its leaves. Its Hebrew name, shaked, signifying \"wakeful, hastening,\" is given to it on account of its putting forth its blossoms so early, generally in February, and sometimes even in January. In  Ecclesiastes 12:5 , it is referred to as illustrative, probably, of the haste with which old age comes. There are others, however, who still contend for the old interpretation here. \"The almond tree bears its blossoms in the midst of winter, on a naked, leafless stem, and these blossoms (reddish or flesh-coloured in the beginning) seem at the time of their fall exactly like white snow-flakes. In this way the almond blossom is a very fitting symbol of old age, with its silvery hair and its wintry, dry, barren, unfruitful condition.\" In  Jeremiah 1:11  \"I see a rod of an almond tree [shaked]...for I will hasten [shaked] my word to perform it\" the word is used as an emblem of promptitude. Jacob desired his sons ( Genesis 43:11 ) to take with them into Egypt of the best fruits of the land, almonds, etc., as a present to Joseph, probably because this tree was not a native of Egypt. Aaron's rod yielded almonds ( Numbers 17:8 ;  Hebrews 9:4 ). Moses was directed to make certain parts of the candlestick for the ark of carved work \"like unto almonds\" ( Exodus 25:33, 34 ). The Hebrew word luz, translated \"hazel\" in the Authorized Version ( Genesis 30:37 ), is rendered in the Revised Version \"almond.\" It is probable that luz denotes the wild almond, while shaked denotes the cultivated variety."], "Word": "Almond", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "5": {"Definitions": ["Levitical city of refuge Joshua 21:18", "Called Alemeth 1 Chronicles 6:60"], "Word": "Almond", "Dictionary": "Naves Topical Index"}, "6": {"Definitions": ["AL'MOND ,  noun", "1.

Others take it to be the name of an evil spirit, or even of Satan. But when we remember that the two goats together form a type of Christ, on whom the Lord \"laid the iniquity of us all,\" and examine into the root meaning of this word (viz., \"separation\"), the interpretation of those who regard the one goat as representing the atonement made, and the other, that \"for Azazel,\" as representing the effect of the great work of atonement (viz., the complete removal of sin), is certainly to be preferred. The one goat which was \"for Jehovah\" was offered as a sin-offering, by which atonement was made. But the sins must also be visibly banished, and therefore they were symbolically laid by confession on the other goat, which was then \"sent away for Azazel\" into the wilderness. The form of this word indicates intensity, and therefore signifies the total separation of sin: it was wholly carried away. It was important that the result of the sacrifices offered by the high priest alone in the sanctuary should be embodied in a visible transaction, and hence the dismissal of the \"scape-goat.\" It was of no consequence what became of it, as the whole import of the transaction lay in its being sent into the wilderness bearing away sin. As the goat \"for Jehovah\" was to witness to the demerit of sin and the need of the blood of atonement, so the goat \"for Azazel\" was to witness to the efficacy of the sacrifice and the result of the shedding of blood in the taking away of sin."], "Word": "Azazel", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "5": {"Definitions": ["the scape-goat"], "Word": "Azazel", "Dictionary": "Hitchcock's Names Dictionary"}, "6": {"Definitions": ["The scapegoat.

In this sense the form of the word is anath(ee)ma, once in plural used in the Greek New Testament, in  Luke 21:5 , where it is rendered \"gifts.\" In the LXX. the form anathema is generally used as the rendering of the Hebrew word herem, derived from a verb which means (1) to consecrate or devote; and (2) to exterminate. Any object so devoted to the Lord could not be redeemed ( Numbers 18:14 ;  Leviticus 27:28, 29 ); and hence the idea of exterminating connected with the word. The Hebrew verb (haram) is frequently used of the extermination of idolatrous nations. It had a wide range of application. The anathema_ or _herem was a person or thing irrevocably devoted to God ( Leviticus 27:21, 28 ); and \"none devoted shall be ransomed. He shall surely be put to death\" ( 27:29 ). The word therefore carried the idea of devoted to destruction ( Numbers 21:2, 3 ;  Joshua 6:17 ); and hence generally it meant a thing accursed. In  Deuteronomy 7:26  an idol is called a herem = anathema, a thing accursed.", "In the New Testament this word always implies execration. In some cases an individual denounces an anathema on himself unless certain conditions are fulfilled ( Acts 23:12, 14, 21 ). \"To call Jesus accursed\" [anathema] ( 1 Corinthians 12:3 ) is to pronounce him execrated or accursed. If any one preached another gospel, the apostle says, \"let him be accursed\" ( Galatians 1:8, 9 ); i.e., let his conduct in so doing be accounted accursed.", "In  Romans 9:3 , the expression \"accursed\" (anathema) from Christ, i.e., excluded from fellowship or alliance with Christ, has occasioned much difficulty. The apostle here does not speak of his wish as a possible thing. It is simply a vehement expression of feeling, showing how strong was his desire for the salvation of his people.", "The anathema in  1 Corinthians 16:22  denotes simply that they who love not the Lord are rightly objects of loathing and execration to all holy beings; they are guilty of a crime that merits the severest condemnation; they are exposed to the just sentence of \"everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord.\""], "Word": "Anathema", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "5": {"Definitions": ["separated; set apart"], "Word": "Anathema", "Dictionary": "Hitchcock's Names Dictionary"}, "6": {"Definitions": ["which literally means a thing suspended, is the equivalent of the Hebrew word signifying a thing or person voted.

An examination of the passages in which it occurs shows that it had acquired a more general sense as expressive either of strong feeling, ( Romans 9:3 ) or of dislike and condemnation.

It grows to a height of 30 feet, has a roundish mass of glossy leaves, and bears an orange coloured fruit that gives out a delicious perfume.

On the other hand Dr Royle says,\"The rich color, fragrant odor and handsome appearance of the citron, whether in flower or in fruit, are particularly suited to the passages of scripture mentioned above.\" But neither the quince nor the citron nor the apple appears fully to answer to all the scriptural allusions.
