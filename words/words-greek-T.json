The Hebrew word so rendered (sopher) is first used to designate the holder of some military office ( Judges 5:14 ; A.V., \"pen of the writer;\" R.V., \"the marshal's staff;\" marg., \"the staff of the scribe\"). The scribes acted as secretaries of state, whose business it was to prepare and issue decrees in the name of the king ( 2 Samuel 8:17 ;  20:25 ;  1 Chronicles 18:16 ;  24:6 ;  1 Kings 4:3 ;  2 Kings 12:9-11 ;  18:18-37 , etc.).

They were engaged in various ways as writers. Such, for example, was Baruch, who \"wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the Lord\" ( Jeremiah 36:4, 32 ).", "In later times, after the Captivity, when the nation lost its independence, the scribes turned their attention to the law, gaining for themselves distinction by their intimate acquaintance with its contents. On them devolved the duty of multiplying copies of the law and of teaching it to others ( Ezra 7:6, 10 -12;  Nehemiah 8:1, 4, 9, 13 ). It is evident that in New Testament times the scribes belonged to the sect of the Pharisees, who supplemented the ancient written law by their traditions (Matthew 23), thereby obscuring it and rendering it of none effect. The titles \"scribes\" and \"lawyers\" (q.v.) are in the Gospels interchangeable ( Matthew 22:35 ;  Mark 12:28 ;  Luke 20:39 , etc.). They were in the time of our Lord the public teachers of the people, and frequently came into collision with him. They afterwards showed themselves greatly hostile to the apostles ( Acts 4:5 ;  6:12 ).", "Some of the scribes, however, were men of a different spirit, and showed themselves friendly to the gospel and its preachers. Thus Gamaliel advised the Sanhedrin, when the apostles were before them charged with \"teaching in this name,\" to \"refrain from these men and let them alone\" ( Acts 5:34-39 ; comp.  23:9 )."], "Word": "Scribes", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "4": {"Definitions": ["(Heb. sopherim ), I.

The  sopherim  were so called because they wrote out the law, or because they classified and arranged its precepts, or because they counted with scrupulous minuteness every elapse and letter It contained. (2) The name of Kirjath-sepher, ( Joshua 15:15 ;  Judges 1:12 ) may possibly connect itself with some early use of the title, and appears to point to military functions of some kind. ( Judges 5:14 ) The men are mentioned as filling the office of scribe under David and Solomon. ( 2 Samuel 8:17 ;  20:25 ;  1 Kings 4:3 ) We may think of them as the king's secretaries, writing his letters, drawing up his decrees, managing his finances. Comp ( 2 Kings 12:10 ) In Hezekiah's time transcribed old records, and became a class of students and interpreters of the law, boasting of their wisdom. ( Jeremiah 8:8 ) After the captivity the office became more prominent, as the exiles would be anxious above all things to preserve the sacred books, the laws, the hymns, the prophecies of the past. II.  Development of doctrine  .", "Of the scribes of this period, with the exception of Ezra and Zadok, ( Nehemiah 13:13 ) we have no record. A later age honored them collectively as the men of the Great Synagogue. Never perhaps, was so important a work done so silently. They devoted themselves to the careful study of the text, and laid down rules for transcribing it with the most scrupulous precision. As time passed on the \"words of the scribes\" were honored above the law. It was a greater crime to offend against them than against the law. The first step was taken toward annulling the commandments of God for the sake of their own traditions. ( Mark 7:13 ) The casuistry became at once subtle and prurient, evading the plainest duties, tampering with conscience. ( Matthew 15:1-6 ;  23:16-23 ) We can therefore understand why they were constantly denounced by our Lord along with the Pharisees. While the scribes repeated the traditions of the elders, he \"spake as one having authority,\" \"not as the scribes.\" ( Matthew 7:29 ) While they confined their teachings to the class of scholars, he \"had compassion on the multitudes.\" ( Matthew 9:36 ) While they were to be found only in the council or in their schools, he journeyed through the cities and villages. ( Matthew 4:23 ;  9:35 ) etc. While they spoke of the kingdom of God vaguely, as a thing far off, he proclaimed that it had already come nigh to men.

Whatever explanation may be given of it, it is true of many, if not of most, of those who have left the stamp of their own character on the religious history of mankind, that they have been liable to pass at times into this abnormal state. The union of intense feeling, strong volition, long-continued thought (the conditions of all wide and lasting influence, aided in many cases by the withdrawal from the lower life of the support which is needed to maintain a healthy equilibrium, appears to have been more than the \"earthen vessel\" will bear. The words which speak of \"an ecstasy of adoration\" are often literally true. As in other things, so also here, the phenomena are common to higher and lower, to true and false systems. We may not point to trances and ecstasies as proofs of a true revelation but still less may we think of them as at all inconsistent with it. Thus though we have not the word, we have the thing in the \"deep sleep\" the \"horror of great darkness,\" that fell on Abraham. ( Genesis 15:12 ) Balaam, as if overcome by the constraining power of a Spirit mightier than his own, \"sees the vision of God, falling, but with opened eyes.\" ( Numbers 24:4 ) Saul, in like manner, when the wild chant of the prophets stirred the old depths of feeling, himself also \"prophesied\" and \"fell down\"", "most, if not all, of his kingly clothing being thrown off in the ecstasy of the moment", "\"all that day and all that night.\" ( 1 Samuel 19:24 ) Something there was in Jeremiah that made men say of him that he was as one that\" is mad and maketh himself a prophet.\" ( Jeremiah 29:26 ) In Ezekiel the phenomena appear in more wonderful and awful forms. ( Ezekiel 3:15 ) As other elements and forms of the prophetic work were revived in \"the apostles and prophets\" of the New Testament, so also was this. Though different in form, it belongs to the same class of phenomena as the gift of tongues, and is connected with \"visions and revelations of the Lord\" In some cases, indeed, it is the chosen channel for such revelations.

Out of this name has grown the tradition that he had a twin-sister, Lydia, or that he was a twin-brother of our Lord; which last, again, would confirm his identification with Judas. Comp. ( Matthew 13:55 ) He is said to have been born at Antioch. In the catalogue of the apostles he is coupled with Matthew in ( Matthew 10:3 ;  Mark 3:18 ;  Luke 6:15 ) and with Philip in ( Acts 1:13 ) All that we know of him is derived from the Gospel of St. John; and this amounts to three traits, which, however, so exactly agree together that, slight as they are they place his character before us with a precision which belongs to no other of the twelve apostles except Peter, John and Judas Iscariot. This character is that of a man slow to believe, seeing all the difficulties of a case, subject to despondency, viewing things on the darker side, yet full of ardent love of his Master. The latter trait was shown in his speech when our Lord determined to face the dangers that awaited him in Judea on his journey to Bethany. Thomas said to his fellow disciples, \"Let us also go, that we may die with him.\" ( John 11:16 ) His unbelief appeared in his question during the Last Supper: \"Thomas saith unto him Lord we know not whither thou goest, and how can we: know the way?\" ( John 14:5 ) It was the prosaic, incredulous doubt as to moving a step in the unseen future, and yet an eager inquiry as to how this step was to be taken. The first-named trait was seen after the resurrection. He was absent", "possibly by accident, perhaps characteristically", "from the first assembly when Jesus had appeared. The others told him what they had seen. He broke forth into an exclamation, the terms of which convey to us at once the vehemence of his doubt, and at the same time the vivid picture that his mind retained of his Master's form as he had last seen him lifeless on the cross. ( John 20:25 ) On the eighth day he was with them st their gathering, perhaps in expectation of a recurrence of the visit of the previous week; and Jesus stood among them. He uttered the same salutation, \"Peace be unto you;\" and then turning to Thomas, as if this had been the special object of his appearance, uttered the words which convey as strongly the sense of condemnation and tender reproof as those of Thomas had shown the sense of hesitation and doubt. The effect on him was immediate. The conviction produced by the removal of his doubt became deeper and stronger than that of any of the other apostles. The words in which he expressed his belief contain a far higher assertion of his Master's divine nature than is contained in any other expression used by apostolic lips", "\"My Lord and my God.\" The answer of our Lord sums up the moral of the whole narrative: \"Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen me, and yet have-believed.\" ( John 20:29 ) In the New Testament we hear of Thomas only twice again, once on the Sea of Galilee with the seven disciples, where he is ranked next after Peter, ( John 21:2 ) and again in the assemblage of the apostles after the ascension. ( Acts 1:13 ) The earlier traditions, as believed in the fourth century, represent him as preaching in Parthia or Persia, and as finally buried at Edessa. The later traditions carry him farther east, His martyrdom whether in Persia or India, is said to have been occasioned by a lance, and is commemorated by the Latin Church on December 21 the Greek Church on October 6, and by the Indians on July 1."], "Word": "Thomas", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}}}

The apostle having formed a high opinion of his \"own son in the faith,\" arranged that he should become his companion ( Acts 16:3 ), and took and circumcised him, so that he might conciliate the Jews. He was designated to the office of an evangelist ( 1 Timothy 4:14 ), and went with Paul in his journey through Phrygia, Galatia, and Mysia; also to Troas and Philippi and Berea ( Acts 17:14 ). Thence he followed Paul to Athens, and was sent by him with Silas on a mission to Thessalonica ( 17:15 ;  1 Thessalonians 3:2 ). We next find him at Corinth ( 1 Thessalonians 1:1 ;  2 Thessalonians 1:1 ) with Paul. He passes now out of sight for a few years, and is again noticed as with the apostle at Ephesus ( Acts 19:22 ), whence he is sent on a mission into Macedonia. He accompanied Paul afterwards into Asia ( 20:4 ), where he was with him for some time. When the apostle was a prisoner at Rome, Timothy joined him ( Philippians 1:1 ), where it appears he also suffered imprisonment ( Hebrews 13:23 ). During the apostle's second imprisonment he wrote to Timothy, asking him to rejoin him as soon as possible, and to bring with him certain things which he had left at Troas, his cloak and parchments ( 2 Timothy 4:13 ).

The father's name is unknown; he was a Greek, i.e. a Gentile, by descent. ( Acts 16:1,3 ) The absence of any personal allusion to the father in the Acts or Epistles suggests the inference that he must have died or disappeared during his son's infancy. The care of the boy thus devolved upon his mother Eunice and her mother Lois. ( 2 Timothy 1:5 ) Under their training his education was emphatically Jewish. \"From a child\" he learned to \"know the Holy Scriptures\" daily. The language of the Acts leaves it uncertain whether Lystra or Derbe was the residence of the devout family. The arrival of Paul and Barnabas in Lycaonia, A.D. 44, ( Acts 14:6 ) brought the message of glad tidings to Timothy and his mother, and they received it with \"unfeigned faith.\" ( 2 Timothy 1:5 ) During the interval of seven years between the apostle's first and second journeys the boy grew up to manhood. Those who had the deepest insight into character, and spoke with a prophetic utterance, pointed to him, ( 1 Timothy 1:18 ;  4:14 ) as others had pointed before to Paul and Barnabas, ( Acts 13:2 ) as specially fit for the missionary work in which the apostle was engaged. Personal feeling led St. Paul to the same conclusion, ( Acts 16:3 ) and he was solemnly set apart to do the work and possibly to bear the title of evangelist. ( 1 Timothy 4:14 ;  2 Timothy 1:6 ;  4:5 ) A great obstacle, however, presented itself. Timothy, though reckoned as one of the seed of Abraham, had been allowed to grow up to the age of manhood without the sign of circumcision. With a special view to the feelings of the Jews making no sacrifice of principle, the apostle, who had refused to permit the circumcision of Titus, \"took and circumcised\" Timothy. ( Acts 16:3 ) Henceforth Timothy was one of his most constant companions. They and Silvanus, and probably Luke also, journeyed to Philippi, ( Acts 16:12 ) and there the young evangelist was conspicuous at once for his filial devotion and his zeal. ( Philemon 2:22 ) His name does not appear in the account of St. Paul's work at Thessalonica, and it is possible that he remained some time at Philippi. He appears, however, at Berea, and remains there when Paul and Silas are obliged to leave, ( Acts 17:14 ) going afterward to join his master at Athens. ( 1 Thessalonians 3:2 ) From Athens he is sent back to Thessalonica, ibid., as having special gifts for comforting and teaching. He returns from Thessalonica, not to Athens, but to Corinth, and his name appears united with St. Paul's in the opening words of both the letters written from that city to the Thessalonians, ( 1 Thessalonians 1:1 ;  2 Thessalonians 1:1 ) Of the next five years of his life we have no record. When we next meet with him, it is as being sent on in advance when the apostle was contemplating the long journey which was to include Macedonia, Achaia, Jerusalem and Rome. ( Acts 19:22 ) It is probable that he returned by the same route and met St. Paul according to a previous arrangement, ( 1 Corinthians 16:11 ) and was thus with him when the Second Epistle was written to the church of Corinth. ( 2 Corinthians 1:1 ) He returns with the apostle to that city, and joins in messages of greeting to the disciples whom he had known personally at Corinth, and who had since found their way to Rome. ( Romans 16:21 ) He forms one of the company of friends who go with St. Paul to Philippi, and then sail by themselves, waiting for his arrival by a different ship. ( Acts 20:3-6 ) The absence of his name from ( Acts 27:1 ) ... leads to the conclusion that he did not share in the perilous voyage to Italy. He must have joined the apostle, however, apparently soon after his arrival at Rome, and was with him when the Epistles to the Philippians, to the Colossians and to Philemon were written. ( Philemon 1:1 ;  2:19 ;  Colossians 1:1 ) Phil. ver. 1. All the indications of this period point to incessant missionary activity. From the two Epistles addressed to Timothy we are able to put together a few notices as to his later from ( 1 Timothy 1:3 ) that he and his master after the release of the latter from his imprisonment, A.D. 63, revisited proconsular Asia; that the apostle then continued his Journey to Macedonia, while the disciple remained, half reluctantly, even weeping at the separation, ( 2 Timothy 1:4 ) at Ephesus, to check, if possible, the outgrowth of heresy and licentiousness which had sprung up there. The position in which he found himself might well make him anxious. He used to rule presbyters most of whom were older than himself ( 1 Timothy 4:12 ) Leaders of rival sects were there. The name of his beloved teacher was no longer honored as it had been. We cannot wonder that the apostle, knowing these trials should be full of anxiety and fear for his disciple's steadfastness. In the Second Epistle to him, A.D. 67 or 68, this deep personal feeling utters itself yet more fully. The last recorded words of the apostle express the earnest hope, repented yet more earnestly, that he might see him once again. ( 2 Timothy 4:9,21 ) We may hazard the conjecture that he reached him in time, and that the last hours of the teacher were soothed by the presence of the disciple whom he loved so truly. Some writers have seen in ( Hebrews 13:23 ) an indication that he even shared St. Paul's imprisonment, and was released from it by the death of Nero. Beyond this all is apocryphal and uncertain. He continued, according to the old traditions, to act as bishop of Ephesus, and died a martyr's death under Domitian or Nerva. A somewhat startling theory as to the intervening period of his life has found favor with some. If he continued, according to the received tradition, to be bishop of Ephesus, then he, and no other, must have been the \"angel\" of the church of Ephesus to whom the message of ( Revelation 2:1-7 ) was addressed."], "Word": "Timothy", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "4": {"Definitions": ["The Epistles to Timothy and Titus are called the Pastoral Epistles, because they are principally devoted to directions about the work of the pastor of a church.

The absence of any local reference but that in ( 1 Timothy 1:3 ) suggests Macedonia or some neighboring district.

He is not mentioned in the Acts at all. Taking the passages in the epistles in the chronological order of the events referred to, we turn first to ( Galatians 2:1,3 ) We conceive the journey mentioned here to be identical with that (recorded in Acts 15) in which Paul and Barnabas went from Antioch to Jerusalem to the conference which was to decide the question of the necessity of circumcision to the Gentiles. Here we see Titus in close association with Paul and Barnabas at Antioch. He goes with them to Jerusalem. His circumcision was either not insisted on at Jerusalem, or, if demanded, was firmly resisted. He is very emphatically spoken of as a Gentile by which is most probably meant that both his parents were Gentiles. Titus would seem on the occasion of the council to have been specially a representative of the church of the uncircumcision. It is to our purpose to remark that, in the passage cited above, Titus is so mentioned as apparently to imply that he had become personally known to the Galatian Christians. After leaving Galatia., ( Acts 18:23 ) and spending a long time at Ephesus, ( Acts 19:1 ;  20:1 ) the apostle proceeded to Macedonia by way of Troas. Here he expected to meet Titus, ( 2 Corinthians 2:13 ) who had been sent on a mission to Corinth. In this hope he was disappointed, but in Macedonia Titus joined him. ( 2 Corinthians 7:6,7,13-15 ) The mission to Corinth had reference to the immoralities rebuked in the First Epistle, and to the collection at that time in progress, for the poor Christians of Judea. ( 2 Corinthians 8:6 ) Thus we are prepared for what the apostle now proceeds to do after his encouraging conversations with Titus regarding the Corinthian church. He sends him back from Macedonia to Corinth, in company with two other trustworthy Christians, bearing the Second Epistle, and with an earnest request, ibid. ( 2 Corinthians 8:6,17 ) that he would see to the completion of the collection. ch. ( 2 Corinthians 8:6 ) A considerable interval now elapses before we come upon the next notices of this disciple. St. Paul's first imprisonment is concluded, and his last trial is impending. In the interval between the two, he and Titus were together in Crete. ( Titus 1:5 ) We see Titus remaining in the island when St. Paul left it and receiving there a letter written to him by the apostle. From this letter we gather the following biographical details. In the first place we learn that he was originally converted through St. Paul's instrumentality. ( Titus 1:4 ) Next we learn the various particulars of the responsible duties which he had to discharge. In Crete, he is to complete what St. Paul had been obliged to leave unfinished, ch. ( Titus 1:5 ) and he is to organize the church throughout the island by appointing presbytery in every city. Next he is to control and bridle, ver. 11, the restless and mischievous Judaizers. He is also to look for the arrival in Crete of Artemas and Tychicus, ch. ( Titus 3:12 ) and then is to hasten to join St. Paul at Nicopolis, where the apostle purposes to pass the winter. Zenas and Apollos are in Crete, or expected there; for Titus is to send them on their journey, and to supply them with whatever they need for it. Whether Titus did join the apostle at Nicopolis we cannot tell; but we naturally connect the mention of this place with what St. Paul wrote, at no great interval of time afterward, in the last of the Pastoral Epistles, ( 2 Timothy 4:10 ) for Dalmatia lay to the north of Nicopolis, at no great distance from it. From the form of the whole sentence, it seems probable that this disciple had been with St. Paul in Rome during his final imprisonment; but this cannot be asserted confidently. The traditional connection of Titus with Crete is much more specific and constant, though here again we cannot be certain of the facts. He said to have been permanent bishop in the island, and to have died there at an advanced age. The modern capital,  Candia  , appears to claim the honor of being his burial-place. In the fragment by the lawyer Zenas, Titus is called bishop of Gortyna.

Tiberias was the capital of Galilee from the time of its origin until the reign of Herod Agrippa II., who changed the seat of power back again to Sepphoris, where it had been before the founding of the new city. Many of the inhabitants were Greeks and Romans, and foreign customs prevailed there: to such an extent as to give offence to the stricter Jews. It is remarkable that the Gospels give us no information that the Saviour who spent so much of his public life in Galilee, ever visited Tiberias. The place is only mentioned in the New Testament in ( John 6:23 )  History  .", "Tiberias has an interesting history apart from its strictly biblical associations. It bore a conspicuous part in the wars between the Jews and the Romans. The Sanhedrin, subsequent to the fall of Jerusalem, after a temporary sojourn at Jamnia and Sepphoris, became fixed there about the middle of the second century. Celebrated schools of Jewish learning flourished there through a succession of several centuries. The Mishna was compiled at this place by the great Rabbi Judah Hakkodesh, A.D. 190. The city has been possessed successively by Romans, Persians Arabs and Turks. It contains now, under the Turkish rule, a mixed population of Mohammedans, Jews and Christian, variously estimated at from two to four thousand.  Present city  .", "The ancient name has survived in that of the modern  Tubarieh  , which occupies the original site. Near  Tubarieh  , about a mile farther south along the shore, are the celebrated warm baths, which the Roman naturalists reckoned among the greatest known curiosities of the world. Tiberias is described by Dr. Thomson as \"a filthy place, fearfully hot in summer.\" It was nearly destroyed in 1837 by an earthquake, by which 800 persons lost their lives."], "Word": "Tiberias", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "5": {"Definitions": ["Called also the Sea of Galilee (q.v.) and of Gennesaret.
