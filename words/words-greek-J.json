He is sometimes called \"the son of Simon,\" ( John 6:71 ;  13:2,26 ) but more commonly ISCARIOTES. ( Matthew 10:4 ;  Mark 3:19 ;  Luke 6:16 ) etc. The name Iscariot has received many interpretations more of less conjectural. The most probable is from  Ish Kerioth  , i.e. \"man of Kerioth,\" a town in the tribe of Judah. ( Joshua 15:25 ) Of the life of Judas before the appearance of his name in the lists of the apostles we know absolutely nothing. What that appearance implies, however, is that he had previously declared himself a disciple. He was drawn, as the others were, by the preaching of the Baptist, or his own Messianic hopes, or the \"gracious words\" of the new Teacher, to leave his former life, and to obey the call of the Prophet of Nazareth. The choice was not made, we must remember, without a provision of its issue. ( John 6:64 ) The germs of the evil, in all likelihood, unfolded themselves gradually. The rules to which the twelve were subject in their first journey, ( Matthew 10:9,10 ) sheltered him from the temptation that would have been most dangerous to him. The new form of life, of which we find the first traces in ( Luke 8:3 ) brought that temptation with it. As soon as the twelve were recognized as a body, travelling hither and thither with their Master, receiving money and other offerings, and redistributing what they received to the poor, it became necessary that some one should act as the steward and almoner of the small society, and this fell to Judas. ( John 12:6 ;  13:29 ) The Galilean or Judean peasant found himself entrusted with larger sums of money than before, and with this there came covetousness, unfaithfulness, embezzlement. Several times he showed his tendency to avarice and selfishness. This, even under the best of influences, grew worse and worse, till he betrayed his Master for thirty pieces of silver. ( Why was such a man chosen to be one of the twelve?", "(1) There was needed among the disciples, as in the Church now, a man of just such talents as Judas possessed,", "the talent for managing business affairs. (2) Though he probably followed Christ at first from mixed motives, as did the other disciples, he had the opportunity of becoming a good and useful man. (3) It doubtless was included in God's plans that there should be thus a standing argument for the truth and honesty of the gospel; for if any wrong or trickery had been concealed, it would have been revealed by the traitor in self-defence. (4) Perhaps to teach the Church that God can bless and the gospel can succeed even though some bad men may creep into the fold.  What was Judas' motive in betraying Christ?", "(1) Anger at the public rebuke given him by Christ at the supper in the house of Simon the leper. ( Matthew 26:6-14 ) (2) Avarice, covetousness, the thirty pieces of silver. ( John 12:6 ) (3) The reaction of feeling in a bad soul against the Holy One whose words and character were a continual rebuke, and who knew the traitors heart. (4) A much larger covetousness,", "an ambition to be the treasurer, not merely of a few poor disciples, but of a great and splendid temporal kingdom of the Messiah. He would hasten on the coming kingdom by compelling Jesus to defend himself. (5) Perhaps disappointment because Christ insisted on foretelling his death instead of receiving his kingdom. He began to fear that there was to be no kingdom, after all. (6) Perhaps, also, Judas \"abandoned what seemed to him a failing cause, and hoped by his treachery to gain a position of honor and influence in the Pharisaic party.\"  The end of Judas.", "(1) Judas, when he saw the results of his betrayal, \"repented himself.\" ( Matthew 27:3-10 ) He saw his sin in a new light, and \"his conscience bounded into fury.\" (2) He made ineffectual struggles to escape, by attempting to return the reward to the Pharisees, and when they would not receive it, he cast it down at their feet and left it.

He is sometimes called \"the son of Simon,\" ( John 6:71 ;  13:2,26 ) but more commonly ISCARIOTES. ( Matthew 10:4 ;  Mark 3:19 ;  Luke 6:16 ) etc. The name Iscariot has received many interpretations more of less conjectural. The most probable is from  Ish Kerioth  , i.e. \"man of Kerioth,\" a town in the tribe of Judah. ( Joshua 15:25 ) Of the life of Judas before the appearance of his name in the lists of the apostles we know absolutely nothing. What that appearance implies, however, is that he had previously declared himself a disciple. He was drawn, as the others were, by the preaching of the Baptist, or his own Messianic hopes, or the \"gracious words\" of the new Teacher, to leave his former life, and to obey the call of the Prophet of Nazareth. The choice was not made, we must remember, without a provision of its issue. ( John 6:64 ) The germs of the evil, in all likelihood, unfolded themselves gradually. The rules to which the twelve were subject in their first journey, ( Matthew 10:9,10 ) sheltered him from the temptation that would have been most dangerous to him. The new form of life, of which we find the first traces in ( Luke 8:3 ) brought that temptation with it. As soon as the twelve were recognized as a body, travelling hither and thither with their Master, receiving money and other offerings, and redistributing what they received to the poor, it became necessary that some one should act as the steward and almoner of the small society, and this fell to Judas. ( John 12:6 ;  13:29 ) The Galilean or Judean peasant found himself entrusted with larger sums of money than before, and with this there came covetousness, unfaithfulness, embezzlement. Several times he showed his tendency to avarice and selfishness. This, even under the best of influences, grew worse and worse, till he betrayed his Master for thirty pieces of silver. ( Why was such a man chosen to be one of the twelve?", "(1) There was needed among the disciples, as in the Church now, a man of just such talents as Judas possessed,", "the talent for managing business affairs. (2) Though he probably followed Christ at first from mixed motives, as did the other disciples, he had the opportunity of becoming a good and useful man. (3) It doubtless was included in God's plans that there should be thus a standing argument for the truth and honesty of the gospel; for if any wrong or trickery had been concealed, it would have been revealed by the traitor in self-defence. (4) Perhaps to teach the Church that God can bless and the gospel can succeed even though some bad men may creep into the fold.  What was Judas' motive in betraying Christ?", "(1) Anger at the public rebuke given him by Christ at the supper in the house of Simon the leper. ( Matthew 26:6-14 ) (2) Avarice, covetousness, the thirty pieces of silver. ( John 12:6 ) (3) The reaction of feeling in a bad soul against the Holy One whose words and character were a continual rebuke, and who knew the traitors heart. (4) A much larger covetousness,", "an ambition to be the treasurer, not merely of a few poor disciples, but of a great and splendid temporal kingdom of the Messiah. He would hasten on the coming kingdom by compelling Jesus to defend himself. (5) Perhaps disappointment because Christ insisted on foretelling his death instead of receiving his kingdom. He began to fear that there was to be no kingdom, after all.

The time was one of political revival in Isr'l; but ere long the Assyrians were to be employed by God as a scourge upon them. The prophet shrank from a commission which he felt sure would result, ( Jonah 4:2 ) in the sparing of a hostile city. He attempted therefore to escape to Tarshish. The providence of God, however, watched over him, first in a storm, and then in his being swallowed by a large fish (a sea monster, probably the white shark) for the space of three days and three nights. [On this subject see article WHALE] After his deliverance, Jonah executed his commission; and the king, \"believing him to be a minister form the supreme deity of the nation,\" and having heard of his miraculous deliverance, ordered a general fast, and averted the threatened judgment. But the prophet, not from personal but national feelings, grudged the mercy shown to a heathen nation. He was therefore taught by the significant lesson of the \"gourd,\" whose growth and decay brought the truth at once home to him, that he was sent to testify by deed, as other prophets would afterward testify by word, the capacity of Gentiles for salvation, and the design of God to make them partakers of it. This was \"the sign of the prophet Jonas.\" ( Luke 11:29,30 ) But the resurrection of Christ itself was also shadowed forth in the history of the prophet.

Pharaoh was well pleased with Joseph's wisdom in interpreting his dreams, and with his counsel with reference to the events then predicted; and he set him over all the land of Egypt ( Genesis 41:46 ), and gave him the name of Zaphnath-paaneah. He was married to Asenath, the daughter of the priest of On, and thus became a member of the priestly class. Joseph was now about thirty years of age.", "As Joseph had interpreted, seven years of plenty came, during which he stored up great abundance of corn in granaries built for the purpose. These years were followed by seven years of famine \"over all the face of the earth,\" when \"all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy corn\" ( Genesis 41:56, 57 ;  47:13, 14 ). Thus \"Joseph gathered up all the money that was in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought.\" Afterwards all the cattle and all the land, and at last the Egyptians themselves, became the property of Pharaoh.", "During this period of famine Joseph's brethren also came down to Egypt to buy corn. The history of his dealings with them, and of the manner in which he at length made himself known to them, is one of the most interesting narratives that can be read (Genesis 42-45). Joseph directed his brethren to return and bring Jacob and his family to the land of Egypt, saying, \"I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land. Regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land is yours.\" Accordingly Jacob and his family, to the number of threescore and ten souls, together with \"all that they had,\" went down to Egypt. They were settled in the land of Goshen, where Joseph met his father, and \"fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while\" ( Genesis 46:29 ).", "The excavations of Dr. Naville have shown the land of Goshen to be the Wady Tumilat, between Ismailia and Zagazig. In Goshen (Egyptian Qosem) they had pasture for their flocks, were near the Asiatic frontier of Egypt, and were out of the way of the Egyptian people. An inscription speaks of it as a district given up to the wandering shepherds of Asia.", "Jacob at length died, and in fulfilment of a promise which he had exacted, Joseph went up to Canaan to bury his father in \"the field of Ephron the Hittite\" ( Genesis 47:29-31 ;  50:1-14 ). This was the last recorded act of Joseph, who again returned to Egypt.", "\"The Story of the Two Brothers,' an Egyptian romance written for the son of the Pharaoh of the Oppression, contains an episode very similar to the Biblical account of Joseph's treatment by Potiphar's wife. Potiphar and Potipherah are the Egyptian Pa-tu-pa-Ra, the gift of the sun-god.' The name given to Joseph, Zaphnath-paaneah, is probably the Egyptian Zaf-nti-pa-ankh, nourisher of the living one,' i.e., of the Pharaoh. There are many instances in the inscriptions of foreigners in Egypt receiving Egyptian names, and rising to the highest offices of state.\"", "By his wife Asenath, Joseph had two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim ( Genesis 41:50 ). Joseph having obtained a promise from his brethren that when the time should come that God would \"bring them unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob,\" they would carry up his bones out of Egypt, at length died, at the age of one hundred and ten years; and \"they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin\" ( Genesis 50:26 ). This promise was faithfully observed. Their descendants, long after, when the Exodus came, carried the body about with them during their forty years' wanderings, and at length buried it in Shechem, in the parcel of ground which Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor ( Joshua 24:32 ; comp.  Genesis 33:19 ). With the death of Joseph the patriarchal age of the history of Israel came to a close.", "The Pharaoh of Joseph's elevation was probably Apepi, or Apopis, the last of the Hyksos kings. Some, however, think that Joseph came to Egypt in the reign of Thothmes III. (see  PHARAOH ), long after the expulsion of the Hyksos.", "The name Joseph denotes the two tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh in  Deuteronomy 33:13-17 ; the kingdom of Israel in  Ezekiel 37:16, 19 ,  Amos 5:6 ; and the whole covenant people of Israel in  Psalms 81:4 .", "2.

He is called a \"just man.\" He was by trade a carpenter ( Matthew 13:55 ). He is last mentioned in connection with the journey to Jerusalem, when Jesus was twelve years old. It is probable that he died before Jesus entered on his public ministry. This is concluded from the fact that Mary only was present at the marriage feast in Cana of Galilee. His name does not appear in connection with the scenes of the crucifixion along with that of Mary (q.v.),  John 19:25 .", "5.  A native of Arimathea, probably the Ramah of the Old Testament ( 1 Samuel 1:19 ), a man of wealth, and a member of the Sanhedrim ( Matthew 27:57 ;  Luke 23:50 ), an \"honourable counsellor, who waited for the kingdom of God.\" As soon as he heard the tidings of Christ's death, he \"went in boldly\" (lit. \"having summoned courage, he went\") \"unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.\" Pilate having ascertained from the centurion that the death had really taken place, granted Joseph's request, who immediately, having purchased fine linen ( Mark 15:46 ), proceeded to Golgotha to take the body down from the cross. There, assisted by Nicodemus, he took down the body and wrapped it in the fine linen, sprinkling it with the myrrh and aloes which Nicodemus had brought ( John 19:39 ), and then conveyed the body to the new tomb hewn by Joseph himself out of a rock in his garden hard by. There they laid it, in the presence of Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of Joses, and other women, and rolled a great stone to the entrance, and departed ( Luke 23:53, 55 ). This was done in haste, \"for the Sabbath was drawing on\" (comp.  Isaiah 53:9 ).", "6.  Surnamed Barsabas ( Acts 1:23 ); also called Justus.

THE APOSTLE, brother of James the \"Greater\" ( Matthew 4:21 ;  10:2 ;  Mark 1:19 ;  3:17 ;  10:35 ).

His father was apparently a man of some wealth (comp.  Mark 1:20 ;  Luke 5:3 ;  John 19:27 ). He was doubtless trained in all that constituted the ordinary education of Jewish youth. When he grew up he followed the occupation of a fisherman on the Lake of Galilee. When John the Baptist began his ministry in the wilderness of Judea, John, with many others, gathered round him, and was deeply influenced by his teaching. There he heard the announcement, \"Behold the Lamb of God,\" and forthwith, on the invitation of Jesus, became a disciple and ranked among his followers ( John 1:36, 37 ) for a time. He and his brother then returned to their former avocation, for how long is uncertain. Jesus again called them (Matthew  4:21 ;  Luke 5:1-11 ), and now they left all and permanently attached themselves to the company of his disciples. He became one of the innermost circle ( Mark 5:37 ;  Matthew 17:1 ;  26:37 ;  Mark 13:3 ). He was the disciple whom Jesus loved. In zeal and intensity of character he was a \"Boanerges\" ( Mark 3:17 ). This spirit once and again broke out ( Matthew 20:20-24 ;  Mark 10:35-41 ;  Luke 9:49, 54 ). At the betrayal he and Peter follow Christ afar off, while the others betake themselves to hasty flight ( John 18:15 ). At the trial he follows Christ into the council chamber, and thence to the praetorium ( 18:16, 19, 28 ) and to the place of crucifixion ( 19:26, 27 ). To him and Peter, Mary first conveys tidings of the resurrection ( 20:2 ), and they are the first to go and see what her strange words mean. After the resurrection he and Peter again return to the Sea of Galilee, where the Lord reveals himself to them ( 21:1, 7 ). We find Peter and John frequently after this together ( Acts 3:1 ;  4:13 ). John remained apparently in Jerusalem as the leader of the church there ( Acts 15:6 ;  Galatians 2:9 ). His subsequent history is unrecorded. He was not there, however, at the time of Paul's last visit ( Acts 21:15-40 ). He appears to have retired to Ephesus, but at what time is unknown. The seven churches of Asia were the objects of his special care ( Revelation 1:11 ). He suffered under persecution, and was banished to Patmos ( 1:9 ); whence he again returned to Ephesus, where he died, probably about A.D. 98, having outlived all or nearly all the friends and companions even of his maturer years.

He hardly sustains the popular notion, fostered by the received types of Christian art, of a nature gentle, yielding, feminine. The name Boanerges, ( Mark 3:17 ) implies a vehemence, zeal, intensity, which gave to those who had it the might of sons of thunder. [ JAMES ] The three are with our Lord when none else are, in the chamber of death, ( Mark 5:37 ) in the glory of the transfiguration, ( Matthew 17:1 ) when he forewarns them of the destruction of the holy city, ( Mark 13:3 ) in the agony of Gethsemane. When the betrayal is accomplished, Peter and John follow afar off. ( John 18:15 ) The personal acquaintance which exited between John and Caiaphas enables him to gain access to the council chamber, pr'torium of the Roman procurator. ( John 18:16,19,28 ) Thence he follows to the place of crucifixion, and the Teacher leaves to him the duty of becoming a son to the mother who is left desolate. ( John 19:26,27 ) It is to Peter and John that Mary Magdalene first runs with the tidings of the emptied sepulchre, ( John 20:2 ) they are the first to go together to see what the strange words meant, John running on most eagerly to the rock-tomb; Peter, the least restrained by awe, the first to enter in and look. ( John 20:4-6 ) For at least eight days they continue in Jerusalem. ( John 20:26 ) Later, on the Sea of Galilee, John is the first to recognize in the dim form seen in the morning twilight the presence of his risen Lord; Peter the first to plunge into the water and swim toward the shore where he stood calling to them. ( John 21:7 ) The last words of John's Gospel reveal to us the deep affection which united the two friends. The history of the Acts shows the same union. They are together at the ascension on the day of Pentecost. Together they enter the temple as worshippers, ( Acts 3:1 ) and protest against the threats of the Sanhedrin. ch ( Acts 4:13 ) The persecution which was pushed on by Saul of Tarsus did not drive John from his post. ch. ( Acts 8:1 ) Fifteen years after St. Paul's first visit he was still at Jerusalem, and helped to take part in the settlement of the great controversy between the Jewish and the Gentile Christians. ( Acts 15:6 ) His subsequent history we know only by tradition. There can be no doubt that he removed from jerusalem and settled at Ephesus, though at what time is uncertain. Tradition goes on to relate that in the persecution under Domitian he is taken to Rome, and there, by his boldness, though not by death, gains the crown of martyrdom. The boiling oil into which he is thrown has no power to hurt him. He is then sent to labor in the mines, and Patmost is the place of his exile. The accession of Nerva frees him from danger, and he returns to Ephesus. Heresies continue to show themselves, but he meets them with the strongest possible protest. The very time of his death lies within the region of conjecture rather than of history, and the dates that have been assigned for it range from A.D. 89 to A.D. 120."], "Word": "John the Apostle", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "6": {"Definitions": ["The \"forerunner of our Lord.\" We have but fragmentary and imperfect accounts of him in the Gospels. He was of priestly descent. His father, Zacharias, was a priest of the course of Abia ( 1 Chronicles 24:10 ), and his mother, Elisabeth, was of the daughters of Aaron ( Luke 1:5 ). The mission of John was the subject of prophecy ( Matthew 3:3 ;  Isaiah 40:3 ;  Malachi 3:1 ). His birth, which took place six months before that of Jesus, was foretold by an angel. Zacharias, deprived of the power of speech as a token of God's truth and a reproof of his own incredulity with reference to the birth of his son, had the power of speech restored to him on the occasion of his circumcision ( Luke 1:64 ). After this no more is recorded of him for thirty years than what is mentioned in  Luke 1:80 . John was a Nazarite from his birth ( Luke 1:15 ;  Numbers 6:1-12 ). He spent his early years in the mountainous tract of Judah lying between Jerusalem and the Dead Sea ( Matthew 3:1-12 ).", "At length he came forth into public life, and great multitudes from \"every quarter\" were attracted to him. The sum of his preaching was the necessity of repentance. He denounced the Sadducees and Pharisees as a \"generation of vipers,\" and warned them of the folly of trusting to external privileges ( Luke 3:8 ). \"As a preacher, John was eminently practical and discriminating. Self-love and covetousness were the prevalent sins of the people at large. On them, therefore, he enjoined charity and consideration for others. The publicans he cautioned against extortion, the soldiers against crime and plunder.\" His doctrine and manner of life roused the entire south of Palestine, and the people from all parts flocked to the place where he was, on the banks of the Jordan. There he baptized thousands unto repentance.", "The fame of John reached the ears of Jesus in Nazareth ( Matthew 3:5 ), and he came from Galilee to Jordan to be baptized of John, on the special ground that it became him to \"fulfil all righteousness\" ( 3:15 ). John's special office ceased with the baptism of Jesus, who must now \"increase\" as the King come to his kingdom. He continued, however, for a while to bear testimony to the Messiahship of Jesus. He pointed him out to his disciples, saying, \"Behold the Lamb of God.\" His public ministry was suddenly (after about six months probably) brought to a close by his being cast into prison by Herod, whom he had reproved for the sin of having taken to himself the wife of his brother Philip ( Luke 3:19 ). He was shut up in the castle of Machaerus (q.v.), a fortress on the southern extremity of Peraea, 9 miles east of the Dead Sea, and here he was beheaded. His disciples, having consigned the headless body to the grave, went and told Jesus all that had occurred ( Matthew 14:3-12 ). John's death occurred apparently just before the third Passover of our Lord's ministry. Our Lord himself testified regarding him that he was a \"burning and a shining light\" ( John 5:35 )."], "Word": "John the Baptist", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "7": {"Definitions": ["was of the priestly race by both parents, for his father, Zacharias, was himself a priest of the course of Abia or Abijah, ( 1 Chronicles 24:10 ) and Elisabeth was of the daughters of Aaron. ( Luke 1:5 ) His birth was foretold by an angel sent from God, and is related at length in Luke 1. The birth of John preceded by six months that of our Lord. John was ordained to be a Nazarite from his birth. ( Luke 1:15 ) Dwelling by himself in the wild and thinly-peopled region westward of the Dead Sea, he prepared himself for the wonderful office to which he had been divinely called. His dress was that of the old prophets", "a garment woven of camel's hair, ( 2 Kings 1:8 ) attached to the body by a leathern girdle. His food was such as the desert afforded", "locusts, ( Leviticus 11:22 ) and wild honey. ( Psalms 81:16 ) And now the long-secluded hermit came forth to the discharge of his office. His supernatural birth, his life, and the general expectation that some great one was about to appear, were sufficient to attract to him a great multitude from \"every quarter.\" ( Matthew 3:5 ) Many of every class pressed forward to confess their sins and to be baptized. Jesus himself came from Galilee to Jordan to be baptized of John. [ JESUS CHRIST ] From incidental notices we learn that John and his disciples continued to baptize some time after our Lord entered upon his ministry. See ( John 3:23 ;  4:1 ;  Acts 19:3 ) We gather also that John instructed his disciples in certain moral and religious duties, as fasting, ( Matthew 9:14 ;  Luke 5:33 ) and prayer. ( Luke 11:1 ) But shortly after he had given his testimony to the Messiah, John's public ministry was brought to a close. In daring disregard of the divine laws, Herod Antipas had taken to himself Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip; and when John reproved him for this, as well as for other sins, ( Luke 3:19 ) Herod cast him into prison. (March, A.D. 28.) The place of his confinement was the castle of Mach'rus, a fortress on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea. It was here that reports reached him of the miracles which our Lord was working in Judea. Nothing but the death of the Baptist would satisfy the resentment of Herodias. A court festival was kept at Mach'rus in honor of the king's birthday. After supper the daughter of Herodias came in and danced the king by her grace that he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she should ask. Salome, prompted by her abandoned mother, demanded the head of John the Baptist. Herod gave instructions to an officer of his guard, who went and executed John in the prison, and his head was brought to feast the eyes of the adulteress whose sins he had denounced. His death is supposed to have occurred just before the third passover, in the course of the Lord's ministry.
