and this for the declared object of attesting that a divine mission is given to that man. It is not, therefore, the  wonder  , the exception to common experience, that constitutes the  miracle  , as is assumed both in the popular use of the word and by most objectors against miracles. No phenomenon in nature, however unusual, no event in the course of God's providence, however unexpected, is a miracle unless it can be traced to the agency of man (including prayer under the term agency), and unless it be put forth as a proof of divine mission. Prodigies and special providences are not miracles. (A miracle is not a  violation of the laws of nature.  It is God's acting upon nature in a degree far beyond our powers, but the same king of act as our wills are continually exerting upon nature. We do not in lifting a stone interfere with any law of nature, but exert a higher force among the laws. Prof. Tyndall says that \"science does assert that without a disturbance of natural law quite as serious as the stoppage of an eclipse, or the rolling of the St. Lawrence up the falls of Niagara, no act of humiliation, individual or nation, could call one shower from heaven.\" And yet men by firing cannon during battle can cause a shower: does that cause such a commotion among the laws of nature? The exertion of a  will  upon the laws does not make a disturbance of natural law; and a miracle is simply the exertion of God's will upon nature.", "ED.) Again, the term \"nature\" suggests to many persons the idea of a great system of things endowed with powers and forces of its own", "a sort of machine, set a-going originally by a first cause, but continuing its motions  of itself.  Hence we are apt to imagine that a change in the motion or operation of any part of it by God would produce the same disturbance of the other parts as such a change would be likely to produce in them if made by us or by any other natural agent. But if the motions and operations of material things be produced really by the divine will, then his choosing to change, for a special purpose, the ordinary motion of one part does not necessarily or probably imply his choosing to change the ordinary motions of other parts in a way not at all requisite for the accomplishment of that special purpose. It is as easy for him to continue the ordinary course of the rest, with the change of one part, as of all the phenomena without any change at all. Thus, though the stoppage of the motion of the earth in the ordinary course of nature would be attended with terrible convulsions, the stoppage of the earth  miraculously  , for a special purpose to be served by  that only  , would not of itself be followed by any such consequences. (Indeed, by the action of gravitation it could be stopped, as a stone thrown up is stopped, in less than two minutes, and yet so gently as not to stir the smallest feather or mote on its surface.", "ED.) From the same conception of nature as a machine, we are apt to think of interferences with the ordinary course of nature as implying some imperfection in it. But it is manifest that this is a false analogy; for the reason why machines are made is to save us trouble; and, therefore, they are more perfect in proportion as they answer this purpose. But no one can seriously imagine that the universe is a machine for the purpose of saving trouble to the Almighty. Again, when miracles are described as \"interferences with the law of nature,\" this description makes them appear improbable to many minds, from their not sufficiently considering that the laws of nature interfere with one another, and that we cannot get rid of \"interferences\" upon any hypothesis consistent with experience. The circumstances of the Christian miracles are utterly unlike those of any pretended instances of magical wonders. This difference consists in", "(1) The greatness, number, completeness and publicity of the miracles. (2) In the character of the miracles. They were all beneficial, helpful, instructive, and worthy of God as their author. (3) The natural beneficial tendency of the doctrine they attested. (4) The connection of them with a whole scheme of revelation extending from the origin of the human race to the time of Christ."], "Word": "Miracles", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}}}

Mark (Marcus,  Colossians 4:10 , etc.) was his Roman name, which gradually came to supersede his Jewish name John. He is called John in  Acts 13:5, 13 , and Mark in  15:39,  2 Timothy 4:11 , etc.", "He was the son of Mary, a woman apparently of some means and influence, and was probably born in Jerusalem, where his mother resided ( Acts 12:12 ). Of his father we know nothing. He was cousin of Barnabas ( Colossians 4:10 ). It was in his mother's house that Peter found \"many gathered together praying\" when he was released from prison; and it is probable that it was here that he was converted by Peter, who calls him his \"son\" ( 1 Peter 5:13 ). It is probable that the \"young man\" spoken of in  Mark 14:51, 52  was Mark himself. He is first mentioned in  Acts 12:25 . He went with Paul and Barnabas on their first journey (about A.D. 47) as their \"minister,\" but from some cause turned back when they reached Perga in Pamphylia ( Acts 12:25 ;  13:13 ). Three years afterwards a \"sharp contention\" arose between Paul and Barnabas ( 15:36-40 ), because Paul would not take Mark with him.

(Marcus was his Latin surname. His Jewish name was John, which is the same as Johanan ( the grace of God ). We can almost trace the steps whereby the former became his prevalent name in the Church. \"John, whose surname was Mark\" in ( Acts 12:12,25 ;  15:37 ) becomes \"John\" alone in ( Acts 13:5,13 ) \"Mark\" in ( Acts 15:39 ) and thenceforward there is no change. ( Colossians 4:10 );  Philemon 1:24 ;  2 Timothy 4:11  The evangelist was the son of a certain Mary, a Jewish matron of some position who dwelt in Jerusalem, ( Acts 12:12 ) and was probably born of a Hellenistic family in that city. Of his father we know nothing; but we do know that the future evangelist was cousin of Barnabas of Cyprus, the great friend of St. Paul. His mother would seem to have been intimately acquainted with St. Peter, and it was to her house, as to a familiar home, that the apostle repaired, A.D. 44, after his deliverance from prison ( Acts 12:12 ) This fact accounts for St. Mark's intimate acquaintance with that apostle, to whom also he probably owed his conversion, for St. Peter calls him his son. ( 1 Peter 5:13 ) We hear Of him for the first time in  Acts 15:25  where we find him accompanying and Barnabas on their return from Jerusalem to Antioch, A.D. 45. He next comes before us on the occasion of the earliest missionary journey of the same apostles, A.D. 48, when he joined them as their \"minister.\" ( Acts 13:8 ) With them he visited Cyprus; but at Perga in Pamphylia, ( Acts 13:13 ) when they were about to enter upon the more arduous part of their mission, he left them, and, for some unexplained reason, returned to Jerusalem to his mother and his home. Notwithstanding this, we find him at Paul's side during that apostle's first imprisonment at Rome, A.D. 61-63, and he Is acknowledged by him as one of his few fellow laborers who had been a \"comfort\" to him during the weary hours of his imprisonment. ( Colossians 4:10,11 );  Philemon 1:24  We next have traces of him in ( 1 Peter 5:13 ) \"The church that is in Babylon ... saluteth you, and so doth Marcus my son.\" From this we infer that he joined his spiritual father, the great friend of his mother, at Babylon, then and for same hundred years afterward one of the chief seats of Jewish culture. From Babylon he would seem to have returned to Asia Minor; for during his second imprisonment A.D. 68 St. Paul, writing to Timothy charges him to bring Mark with him to me, on the ground that he was \"profitable to him For the ministry.\" ( 2 Timothy 4:11 ) From this point we gain no further information from the New Testament respecting the evangelist. It is most probable, however that he did join the apostle at Rome whither also St. Peter would seem to have proceeded, and suffered martyrdom with St. Paul.

They inhabited principally the desert north of the peninsula of Arabia. The peninsula of Sinai was the pasture-ground for their flocks. They were virtually the rulers of Arabia, being the dominant tribe. Like all Arabians, they were a nomad people. They early engaged in commercial pursuits. It was to one of their caravans that Joseph was sold ( Genesis 37:28, 36 ). The next notice of them is in connection with Moses' flight from Egypt ( Exodus 2:15-21 ). Here in Midian Moses became the servant and afterwards the son-in-law of Reuel or Jethro, the priest. After the Exodus, the Midianites were friendly to the Israelites so long as they traversed only their outlying pasture-ground on the west of the Arabah; but when, having passed the southern end of Edom, they entered into the land of Midian proper, they joined with Balak, the king of Moab, in a conspiracy against them ( Numbers 22:4-7) . Balaam, who had been sent for to curse Israel, having utterly failed to do so, was dismissed by the king of Moab; nevertheless he still tarried among the Midianites, and induced them to enter into correspondence with the Israelites, so as to bring them into association with them in the licentious orgies connected with the worship of Baal-Peor. This crafty counsel prevailed. The Israelites took part in the heathen festival, and so brought upon themselves a curse indeed. Their apostasy brought upon them a severe punishment. A plague broke out amongst them, and more than twenty-four thousand of the people perished ( Numbers 25:9 ). But the Midianites were not to be left unpunished. A terrible vengeance was denounced against them. A thousand warriors from each tribe, under the leadership of Phinehas, went forth against them. The Midianites were utterly routed. Their cities were consumed by fire, five of their kings were put to death, and the whole nation was destroyed ( Joshua 13:21, 22 ). Balaam also perished by the sword, receiving the \"wages of his unrighteousness\" ( Numbers 31:8 ;  2 Peter 2:15 ). The whole of the country on the east of Jordan, now conquered by the Israelites (see  SIHON ;  OG ), was divided between the two tribes of Reuben and Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh.", "Some two hundred and fifty years after this the Midianites had regained their ancient power, and in confederation with the Amalekites and the \"children of the east\" they made war against their old enemies the Israelites, whom for seven years they oppressed and held in subjection. They were at length assailed by Gideon in that ever-memorable battle in the great plain of Esdraelon, and utterly destroyed ( Judges 6:1 - ch. 7 ). Frequent allusions are afterwards made to this great victory ( Psalms 83:10, 12 ;  Isaiah 9:4 ;  10:6 ).

The ancient furnaces are still to be seen, and on the coast of the Red Sea are found the piers and wharves whence the miners shipped their metal in the harbor of Abu Zelimeh. Three methods were employed for refining gold and silver: (1) by exposing the fused metal to a current of air; (2) by keeping the alloy in a state of fusion and throwing nitre upon it; and (3) by mixing the alloy with lead, exposing the whole to fusion upon a vessel of bone-ashes or earth, and blowing upon it with bellows or other blast. There seems to be reference to the latter in ( Psalms 12:6 ;  Jeremiah 6:28-30 ;  Ezekiel 22:18-22 ) The chief supply of silver in the ancient world appears to have been brought from Spain.

We first hear of Mesopotamia in Scripture as the country where Nahor and his family settled after quitting Ur of the Chaldees.

Hither too, a century later, came Jacob on the same errand; and hence he returned with his two wives after an absence of twenty-one years. After this we have no mention of Mesopotamia till the close of the wanderings int he wilderness. ( 23:4 ) About half a century later we find, for the first and last time, Mesopotamia the seat of a powerful monarchy. ( Judges 3:1 ) ... Finally, the children of Ammon, having provoked a war with David, \"sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syria-maachah, and out of Zobah.\" ( 1 Chronicles 19:6 ) According to the Assyrian inscriptions Mesopotamia was inhabited in the early times of the empire, B.C. 1200-1100, by a vast number of petty tribes, each under its own prince, and all quite independent of one another. The Assyrian monarchs contended with these chiefs at great advantage, and by the time of Jehu, B.C. 880, had fully established their dominion over them. On the destruction of the Assyrian empire, Mesopotamia seems to have been divided between the Medes and the Babylonians. The conquests of Cyrus brought it wholly under the Persian yoke; and thus it continued to the time of Alexander. Since 1516 it has formed a part of the Turkish empire.

Still we have no trace of any philosophical or rational system of Egyptian origin; still medicine in Egypt was a mere art or profession. Compared with the wild countries around them, however, the Egyptians must have seemed incalculably advanced. Representations of early Egyptian surgery apparently occur on some of the monuments of Beni-Hassan. Those who have assisted at the opening of a mummy have noticed that the teeth exhibited a dentistry not inferior in execution to the work of the best modern experts. This confirms the statement of Herodotus that every part of the body was studied by a distinct practitioner. The reputation of Egypt's practitioners in historical times was such that both Cyrus and Darius sent to that country for physicians or surgeons. Of midwifery we have a distinct notice, ( Exodus 1:1 ) and of women as its Practitioners, which fact may also be verified from the scriptures. The scrupulous attention paid to the dead was favorable to the health of the living. The practice of physic was not among the Jews a privilege of the priesthood. Any one might practice it, and this publicity must have kept it pure. Rank and honor are said to be the portion of the physician, and his office to be from the Lord. Ecclus. 38.1,3,12. To bring down the subject to the period of the New Testament, St. Luke, \"the beloved physician,\" who practiced at Antioch whilst the body was his care, could hardly have failed to be convenient with all the leading opinions current down to his own time. Among special diseases named in the Old Testament is ophthalmia, ( Genesis 29:17 ) which is perhaps more common in Syria and Egypt than anywhere else in the world; especially in the fig season, the juice of the newly-ripe fruit having the power of giving it. It may occasion partial or total blindness. ( 2 Kings 6:18 ) The \"burning boil,\" ( Leviticus 13:23 ) is merely marked by the notion of an effect resembling that of fire, like our \"carbuncle.\" The diseases rendered \"scab\" and \"scurvy\" in ( Leviticus 21:20 ;  22:22 ;  28:27 ) may be almost any skin disease. Some of these may be said to approach the type of leprosy. The \"botch ( shechin ) of Egypt,\" ( 28:27 ) is so vague a term as to yield a most uncertain sense. In ( 28:35 ) is mentioned a disease attacking the \"knees and legs,\" consisting in a \"sore botch which cannot be healed,\" but extended, in the sequel of the verse, from the \"sole of the foot to the top of the head.\" The  Elephantiasis gracorum  is what now passes under the name of \"leprosy;\" the lepers, e.g., of the- huts near the Zion gate of modern Jerusalem are elephantissiacs. [ LEPER, LEPROSY ] The disease of King Antiochus, 2 Macc. 9.5-10, etc., was that of a boil breeding worms. The case of the widow's son restored by Elisha, ( 2 Kings 4:19 ) was probably one of sunstroke. The palsy meets us in the New Testament only, and in features too familiar to need special remark. palsy, gangrene and cancer were common in all the countries familiar to the scriptural writers, and neither differs from the modern disease of the same name. Mention is also made of the bites and stings of poisonous reptiles. ( Numbers 21:6 ) Among surgical instruments or pieces of apparatus the following only are alluded to in Scripture- A cutting instrument, supposed a \"sharp stone,\" ( Exodus 4:25 ) the \"knife\" of ( Joshua 5:2 ) The \"awl\" of ( Exodus 21:6 ) was probably a surgical instrument. The \"roller to bind\" of ( Ezekiel 30:21 ) was for a broken limb, and is still used. A scraper, for which the \"potsherd\" of Job was a substitute. ( Job 2:8 ;  Exodus 30:23-25 ) is a prescription in form. An occasional trace occurs of some chemical knowledge, e.g. the calcination of the gold by Moses, ( Exodus 32:20 ) the effect of \"vinegar upon natron,\" ( Proverbs 25:20 ); comp.  Jeremiah 2:22  The mention of \"the apothecary,\" ( Exodus 30:35 ;  Ecclesiastes 10:1 ) and of the merchant in \"powders,\" ( Solomon 3:6 ) shows that a distinct and important branch of trade was set up in these wares, in which, as at a modern druggist's, articles of luxury, etc., are combined with the remedies of sickness. Among the most favorite of external remedies has always been the bath. There were special occasions on which the bath was ceremonially enjoined. The Pharisees and Essenes aimed at scrupulous strictness in all such rules. ( Matthew 15:2 ;  Mark 7:5 ;  Luke 11:38 ) River-bathing was common but houses soon began to include a bathroom.

Here we have its original charter, which was confirmed by our Lord, as the basis on which all regulations are to be framed ( Matthew 19:4, 5 ). It is evident that monogamy was the original law of marriage ( Matthew 19:5 ;  1 Corinthians 6:16 ). This law was violated in after times, when corrupt usages began to be introduced ( Genesis 4:19 ;  6:2 ). We meet with the prevalence of polygamy and concubinage in the patriarchal age ( Genesis 16:1-4;   22:21-24 ;  28:8, 9 ;  29:23-30 , etc.). Polygamy was acknowledged in the Mosaic law and made the basis of legislation, and continued to be practised all down through the period of Jewish histroy to the Captivity, after which there is no instance of it on record.", "It seems to have been the practice from the beginning for fathers to select wives for their sons ( Genesis 24:3 ;  38:6 ). Sometimes also proposals were initiated by the father of the maiden ( Exodus 2:21 ). The brothers of the maiden were also sometimes consulted ( Genesis 24:51 ;  34:11 ), but her own consent was not required. The young man was bound to give a price to the father of the maiden ( 31:15 ;  34:12 ;  Exodus 22:16, 17 ;  1 Samuel 18:23, 25 ;  Ruth 4:10 ;  Hosea 3:2 ) On these patriarchal customs the Mosaic law made no change.", "In the pre-Mosaic times, when the proposals were accepted and the marriage price given, the bridegroom could come at once and take away his bride to his own house ( Genesis 24:63-67 ). But in general the marriage was celebrated by a feast in the house of the bride's parents, to which all friends were invited ( 29:22, 27 ); and on the day of the marriage the bride, concealed under a thick veil, was conducted to her future husband's home.", "Our Lord corrected many false notions then existing on the subject of marriage ( Matthew 22:23-30 ), and placed it as a divine institution on the highest grounds. The apostles state clearly and enforce the nuptial duties of husband and wife ( Ephesians 5:22-33 ;  Colossians 3:18, 19 ;  1 Peter 3:1-7) .

Rising from the ground and retiring to the seats round the walls, the guests then sit down cross-legged and gossip, or listen to recitals, or puzzle over riddles, light being scantily supplied by a small lamp or two, or if the night be chilly, by a smouldering fire of weeds kindled in the middle of the room, perhaps in a brazier, often in a hole in the floor.

( Numbers 10:10 ;  28:11-14 ) The commencement of the month was generally decided by observation of the new moon. The usual number of months in a year was twelve, as implied in ( 1 Kings 4:7 ;  1 Chronicles 27:1-15 ) but since twelve lunar months would make but 354 1/2 days, the years would be short twelve days of the short twelve days of the true year, and therefore it follows as a matter of course that an additional month must have been inserted about every third year, which would bring the number up to thirteen. No notice, however, is taken of this month in the Bible. In the modern Jewish calendar the intercalary month is introduced seven times in every nineteen years. The usual method of designating the months was by their numerical order, e.g. \"the second month,\" ( Genesis 7:11 ) \"the fourth month,\" ( 2 Kings 25:3 ) and this was generally retained even when the names were given, e.g. \"in the month Zif, which is the second month.\" ( 1 Kings 6:1 ) The names of the months belong to two distinct periods. In the first place we have those peculiar to the period of Jewish independence, of which four only, even including Abib, which we hardly regard as a proper name are mentioned, viz.- Abib, in which the passover fell, ( Exodus 13:4 ;  23:15 ;  34:18 ;  16:1 ) and which was established as the first month in commemoration of the exodus, ( Exodus 12:2 ) Zif, the second month, ( 1 Kings 6:1,37 ) Bul, the eighth, ( 1 Kings 6:38 ) and Ethanim, the seventh. ( 1 Kings 6:38 ) and Ethanim, the seventh. ( 1 Kings 8:2 ) In the second place we have the names which prevailed subsequent to the Babylonish captivity; of these the following seven appear in the Bible- Nisan, the first, in which the passover was held, ( Nehemiah 2:1 ;  Esther 3:7 ) Sivan, the third ( Esther 8:9 ) Bar. 1.8; Elul, the sixth, ( Nehemiah 6:15 ) 1 Macc. 14.27; Chisleu, the ninth, ( Nehemiah 1:1 ;  Zechariah 7:1 ) 1 Macc. 1.54; Tebeth, the tenth, ( Esther 2:16 ) Sebat, the eleventh, ( Zechariah 1:7 ) 1 Macc. 16.14; and Adar, the twelfth. ( Esther 3:7 ;  8:1 ) 2 Macc. 15.36. The names of the remaining five occur int he Talmud and other works; they were, Iyar, the second, Targum; ( 2 Chronicles 30:2 ) Tammuz, the fourth; Ab, the fifth; Tisri, the seventh; and Marcheshvan, the eighth. The name of the intercalary month was Ve-adar, i.e. the  additional  Adar. The identification of the jewish months with our own cannot be effected with precision on account of the variations that must inevitably exist between the lunar and the solar month. Nisan (or Abib) answers to March; Zif or Iyar to May; Sivan to June; Tammuz to July; Ab to August; Elul to September; Ethanim or Tisri to October; Bul or Marcheshvan to November; Chisleu to December; Tebeth to January; Sebat to February; and Adar to March."], "Word": "Month", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "4": {"Definitions": ["MONTH ,  noun   [Latin  mensis; Gr. a  month   from the moon.] A space or period of time constituting a division of the year.  month  originally signified the time of one revolution of the moon, a lunation, or the period from one change or conjunction of the moon with the sun to another, a period of 27 days, 7 hours, 43 minutes and 5 seconds.

( Numbers 10:10 ;  28:11-14 ) The commencement of the month was generally decided by observation of the new moon. The usual number of months in a year was twelve, as implied in ( 1 Kings 4:7 ;  1 Chronicles 27:1-15 ) but since twelve lunar months would make but 354 1/2 days, the years would be short twelve days of the short twelve days of the true year, and therefore it follows as a matter of course that an additional month must have been inserted about every third year, which would bring the number up to thirteen. No notice, however, is taken of this month in the Bible. In the modern Jewish calendar the intercalary month is introduced seven times in every nineteen years. The usual method of designating the months was by their numerical order, e.g. \"the second month,\" ( Genesis 7:11 ) \"the fourth month,\" ( 2 Kings 25:3 ) and this was generally retained even when the names were given, e.g. \"in the month Zif, which is the second month.\" ( 1 Kings 6:1 ) The names of the months belong to two distinct periods. In the first place we have those peculiar to the period of Jewish independence, of which four only, even including Abib, which we hardly regard as a proper name are mentioned, viz.- Abib, in which the passover fell, ( Exodus 13:4 ;  23:15 ;  34:18 ;  16:1 ) and which was established as the first month in commemoration of the exodus, ( Exodus 12:2 ) Zif, the second month, ( 1 Kings 6:1,37 ) Bul, the eighth, ( 1 Kings 6:38 ) and Ethanim, the seventh. ( 1 Kings 6:38 ) and Ethanim, the seventh. ( 1 Kings 8:2 ) In the second place we have the names which prevailed subsequent to the Babylonish captivity; of these the following seven appear in the Bible- Nisan, the first, in which the passover was held, ( Nehemiah 2:1 ;  Esther 3:7 ) Sivan, the third ( Esther 8:9 ) Bar. 1.8; Elul, the sixth, ( Nehemiah 6:15 ) 1 Macc. 14.27; Chisleu, the ninth, ( Nehemiah 1:1 ;  Zechariah 7:1 ) 1 Macc. 1.54; Tebeth, the tenth, ( Esther 2:16 ) Sebat, the eleventh, ( Zechariah 1:7 ) 1 Macc. 16.14; and Adar, the twelfth. ( Esther 3:7 ;  8:1 ) 2 Macc. 15.36. The names of the remaining five occur int he Talmud and other works; they were, Iyar, the second, Targum; ( 2 Chronicles 30:2 ) Tammuz, the fourth; Ab, the fifth; Tisri, the seventh; and Marcheshvan, the eighth. The name of the intercalary month was Ve-adar, i.e. the  additional  Adar. The identification of the jewish months with our own cannot be effected with precision on account of the variations that must inevitably exist between the lunar and the solar month. Nisan (or Abib) answers to March; Zif or Iyar to May; Sivan to June; Tammuz to July; Ab to August; Elul to September; Ethanim or Tisri to October; Bul or Marcheshvan to November; Chisleu to December; Tebeth to January; Sebat to February; and Adar to March."], "Word": "Month", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "4": {"Definitions": ["MONTH ,  noun   [Latin  mensis; Gr. a  month   from the moon.] A space or period of time constituting a division of the year.  month  originally signified the time of one revolution of the moon, a lunation, or the period from one change or conjunction of the moon with the sun to another, a period of 27 days, 7 hours, 43 minutes and 5 seconds.

Here we have its original charter, which was confirmed by our Lord, as the basis on which all regulations are to be framed ( Matthew 19:4, 5 ). It is evident that monogamy was the original law of marriage ( Matthew 19:5 ;  1 Corinthians 6:16 ). This law was violated in after times, when corrupt usages began to be introduced ( Genesis 4:19 ;  6:2 ). We meet with the prevalence of polygamy and concubinage in the patriarchal age ( Genesis 16:1-4;   22:21-24 ;  28:8, 9 ;  29:23-30 , etc.). Polygamy was acknowledged in the Mosaic law and made the basis of legislation, and continued to be practised all down through the period of Jewish histroy to the Captivity, after which there is no instance of it on record.", "It seems to have been the practice from the beginning for fathers to select wives for their sons ( Genesis 24:3 ;  38:6 ). Sometimes also proposals were initiated by the father of the maiden ( Exodus 2:21 ). The brothers of the maiden were also sometimes consulted ( Genesis 24:51 ;  34:11 ), but her own consent was not required. The young man was bound to give a price to the father of the maiden ( 31:15 ;  34:12 ;  Exodus 22:16, 17 ;  1 Samuel 18:23, 25 ;  Ruth 4:10 ;  Hosea 3:2 ) On these patriarchal customs the Mosaic law made no change.", "In the pre-Mosaic times, when the proposals were accepted and the marriage price given, the bridegroom could come at once and take away his bride to his own house ( Genesis 24:63-67 ). But in general the marriage was celebrated by a feast in the house of the bride's parents, to which all friends were invited ( 29:22, 27 ); and on the day of the marriage the bride, concealed under a thick veil, was conducted to her future husband's home.", "Our Lord corrected many false notions then existing on the subject of marriage ( Matthew 22:23-30 ), and placed it as a divine institution on the highest grounds. The apostles state clearly and enforce the nuptial duties of husband and wife ( Ephesians 5:22-33 ;  Colossians 3:18, 19 ;  1 Peter 3:1-7) .

Rising from the ground and retiring to the seats round the walls, the guests then sit down cross-legged and gossip, or listen to recitals, or puzzle over riddles, light being scantily supplied by a small lamp or two, or if the night be chilly, by a smouldering fire of weeds kindled in the middle of the room, perhaps in a brazier, often in a hole in the floor.

(Marcus was his Latin surname. His Jewish name was John, which is the same as Johanan ( the grace of God ). We can almost trace the steps whereby the former became his prevalent name in the Church. \"John, whose surname was Mark\" in ( Acts 12:12,25 ;  15:37 ) becomes \"John\" alone in ( Acts 13:5,13 ) \"Mark\" in ( Acts 15:39 ) and thenceforward there is no change.

Of his father we know nothing; but we do know that the future evangelist was cousin of Barnabas of Cyprus, the great friend of St. Paul. His mother would seem to have been intimately acquainted with St. Peter, and it was to her house, as to a familiar home, that the apostle repaired, A.D. 44, after his deliverance from prison ( Acts 12:12 ) This fact accounts for St. Mark's intimate acquaintance with that apostle, to whom also he probably owed his conversion, for St. Peter calls him his son. ( 1 Peter 5:13 ) We hear Of him for the first time in  Acts 15:25  where we find him accompanying and Barnabas on their return from Jerusalem to Antioch, A.D. 45. He next comes before us on the occasion of the earliest missionary journey of the same apostles, A.D. 48, when he joined them as their \"minister.\" ( Acts 13:8 ) With them he visited Cyprus; but at Perga in Pamphylia, ( Acts 13:13 ) when they were about to enter upon the more arduous part of their mission, he left them, and, for some unexplained reason, returned to Jerusalem to his mother and his home. Notwithstanding this, we find him at Paul's side during that apostle's first imprisonment at Rome, A.D. 61-63, and he Is acknowledged by him as one of his few fellow laborers who had been a \"comfort\" to him during the weary hours of his imprisonment. ( Colossians 4:10,11 );  Philemon 1:24  We next have traces of him in ( 1 Peter 5:13 ) \"The church that is in Babylon ... saluteth you, and so doth Marcus my son.\" From this we infer that he joined his spiritual father, the great friend of his mother, at Babylon, then and for same hundred years afterward one of the chief seats of Jewish culture. From Babylon he would seem to have returned to Asia Minor; for during his second imprisonment A.D. 68 St. Paul, writing to Timothy charges him to bring Mark with him to me, on the ground that he was \"profitable to him For the ministry.\" ( 2 Timothy 4:11 ) From this point we gain no further information from the New Testament respecting the evangelist. It is most probable, however that he did join the apostle at Rome whither also St. Peter would seem to have proceeded, and suffered martyrdom with St. Paul.

This appears probable when it is considered that it makes no reference to the Jewish law, and that the writer takes care to interpret words which a Gentile would be likely to misunderstand, such as, \"Boanerges\" ( 3:17 ); \"Talitha cumi\" ( 5:41 ); \"Corban\" ( 7:11 ); \"Bartimaeus\" ( 10:46 ); \"Abba\" ( 14:36 ); \"Eloi,\" etc. ( 15:34 ). Jewish usages are also explained ( 7:3 ;  14:3 ;  14:12 ;  15:42 ). Mark also uses certain Latin words not found in any of the other Gospels, as \"speculator\" ( 6:27,  rendered, A.V., \"executioner;\" R.V., \"soldier of his guard\"), \"xestes\" (a corruption of sextarius, rendered \"pots,\"  7:4, 8 ), \"quadrans\" ( 12:42,  rendered \"a farthing\"), \"centurion\" ( 15:39, 44, 45 ). He only twice quotes from the Old Testament ( 1:2 ;  15:28 ).", "The characteristics of this Gospel are, (1) the absence of the genealogy of our Lord, (2) whom he represents as clothed with power, the \"lion of the tribe of Judah.\"", "3.  Mark also records with wonderful minuteness the very words ( 3:17 ;  5:41 ;  7:11, 34 ;  14:36 ) as well as the position ( 9:35 ) and gestures ( 3:5, 34 ;  5:32 ;  9:36 ;  10:16 ) of our Lord.", "4.  He is also careful to record particulars of person ( 1:29, 36 ;  3:6, 22 , etc.), number ( 5:13 ;  6:7,  etc.), place ( 2:13 ;  4:1 ;  7:31,  etc.), and time ( 1:35 ;  2:1 ;  4:35,  etc.), which the other evangelists omit.", "5.  The phrase \"and straightway\" occurs nearly forty times in this Gospel; while in Luke's Gospel, which is much longer, it is used only seven times, and in John only four times.", "\"The Gospel of Mark,\" says Westcott, \"is essentially a transcript from life. The course and issue of facts are imaged in it with the clearest outline.\" \"In Mark we have no attempt to draw up a continuous narrative. His Gospel is a rapid succession of vivid pictures loosely strung together without much attempt to bind them into a whole or give the events in their natural sequence. This pictorial power is that which specially characterizes this evangelist, so that if any one desires to know an evangelical fact, not only in its main features and grand results, but also in its most minute and so to speak more graphic delineation, he must betake himself to Mark.'\" The leading principle running through this Gospel may be expressed in the motto- \"Jesus came...preaching the gospel of the kingdom\" ( Mark 1:14 ).", "\"Out of a total of 662 verses, Mark has 406 in common with Matthew and Luke, 145 with Matthew, 60 with Luke, and at most 51 peculiar to itself.\" (See  MATTHEW .)"], "Word": "Mark, Gospel According To", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "7": {"Definitions": [], "Word": "Mark, Gospel of", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}, "8": {"Definitions": ["M'ARKABLE ,  adjective   Remarkable.

It was a custom of the Jews to give those who were condemned to death by crucifixion \"wine mingled with myrrh\" to produce insensibility. This drugged wine was probably partaken of by the two malefactors, but when the Roman soldiers pressed it upon Jesus \"he received it not\" ( Mark 15:23 ).

Another word lot is also translated \"myrrh\" ( Genesis 37:25 ;  43:11 ; R.V., marg., \"or ladanum\"). What was meant by this word is uncertain. It has been thought to be the chestnut, mastich, stacte, balsam, turpentine, pistachio nut, or the lotus. It is probably correctly rendered by the Latin word ladanum, the Arabic ladan, an aromatic juice of a shrub called the Cistus or rock rose, which has the same qualities, though in a slight degree, of opium, whence a decoction of opium is called laudanum.

From this subjection they achieved deliverance, and formed themselves into an empire under Cyaxares (B.C. 633). This monarch entered into an alliance with the king of Babylon, and invaded Assyria, capturing and destroying the city of Nineveh (B.C. 625), thus putting an end to the Assyrian monarchy ( Nahum 1:8 ;  2:5, 6 ;  3:13, 14 ).", "Media now rose to a place of great power, vastly extending its boundaries.

The simplest and probably most ancient method of preparing corn for food was by pounding it between two stones. The Isr'lites in the desert appear to have possessed mortars and handmills among their necessary domestic utensils. When the manna fell they gathered it, and either ground it in the mill or pounded it in the mortar till it was fit for use. ( Numbers 11:8 ) So in the present day stone mortars are used by the Arabs to pound wheat for their national dish  kibby  . Another word occurring in ( Proverbs 27:22 ) probably denotes a mortar of a larger kind in which corn was pounded: \"Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.\" Corn may be separated from its husk and all its good properties preserved by such an operation, but the fool's folly is so essential a part of himself that no analogous process can remove it from him. Such seems the natural interpretation of this remarkable proverb. The language is intentionally exaggerated, and there is no necessity for supposing an allusion to a mode of punishment by which criminals were put to death by being pounded in a mortar.

Moab was the son of the Lot's eldest daughter, the progenitor of the Moabites. Zoar was the cradle of the race of Lot. From this centre the brother tribes spread themselves. The Moabites first inhabited the rich highlands which crown the eastern side of the chasm of the Dead Sea, extending as far north as the mountain of Gilead, from which country they expelled the Emims, the original inhabitants, ( 2:11 ) but they themselves were afterward driven southward by the warlike Amorites, who had crossed the Jordan, and were confined to the country south of the river Arnon, which formed their northern boundary. ( Numbers 21:13 ;  Judges 11:18 ) The territory occupied by Moab at the period of its greatest extent, before the invasion of the Amorites, divided itself naturally into three distinct and independent portions:", "(1) The enclosed corner or canton south of the Arnon was the \"field of Moab.\" ( Ruth 1:1,2,6 ) etc. (2) The more open rolling country north of the Arnon, opposite Jericho, and up to the hills of Gilead, was the \"land of Moab.\" ( 1:5 ;  32:49 ) etc. (3) The sunk district in the tropical depths of the Jordan valley. ( Numbers 22:1 ) etc. The Isr'lites, in entering the promised land, did not pass through the Moabites, ( Judges 11:18 ) but conquered the Amorites, who occupied the country from which the Moabites had been so lately expelled. After the conquest of Canaan the relations of Moab with Isr'l were of a mixed character, sometimes warlike and sometimes peaceable. With the tribe of Benjamin they had at least one severe struggle, in union with their kindred the Ammonites. ( Judges 3:12-30 ) The story of Ruth, on the other hand, testifies to the existence of a friendly intercourse between Moab and Bethlehem, one of the towns of Judah. By his descent from Ruth, David may be said to have had Moabite blood in his veins. He committed his parents to the protection of the king of Moab, when hard pressed by Saul. ( 1 Samuel 22:3,4 ) But here all friendly relations stop forever. The next time the name is mentioned is in the account of David's war, who made the Moabites tributary. ( 2 Samuel 8:2 ;  1 Chronicles 18:2 ) At the disruption of the kingdom Moab seems to have fallen to the northern realm. At the death of Ahab the Moabites refused to pay tribute and asserted their independence, making war upon the kingdom of Judah. ( 2 Chronicles 22:1 ) ... As a natural consequence of the late events, Isr'l, Judah and Edom united in an attack on Moab, resulting in the complete overthrow of the Moabites. Falling back into their own country, they were followed and their cities and farms destroyed. Finally, shut up within the walls of his own capital, the king, Mesha, in the sight of the thousands who covered the sides of that vast amphitheater, killed and burnt his child as a propitiatory sacrifice to the cruel gods of his country. Isaiah, chs. ( Isaiah 15,16,25:10-12 ) predicts the utter annihilation of the Moabites; and they are frequently denounced by the subsequent prophets. For the religion of the Moabites see CHEMOSH; MOLECH; PEOR. See also Tristram's \"Land of Moab.\"  Present condition.", "(Noldeke says that the extinction of the Moabites was about A.D. 200, at the time when the Yemen tribes Galib and Gassara entered the eastern districts of the Jordan. Since A.D. 536 the last trace of the name Moab, which lingered in the town of Kir-moab, has given place to  Kerak  , its modern name. Over the whole region are scattered many ruins of ancient cities; and while the country is almost bare of larger vegetation, it is still a rich pasture-ground, with occasional fields of grain.

From Zoar, the cradle of this tribe, on the south-eastern border of the Dead Sea, they gradually spread over the region on the east of Jordan. Rameses II., the Pharaoh of the Oppression, enumerates Moab (Muab) among his conquests. Shortly before the Exodus, the warlike Amorites crossed the Jordan under Sihon their king and drove the Moabites ( Numbers 21:26-30 ) out of the region between the Arnon and the Jabbok, and occupied it, making Heshbon their capital. They were then confined to the territory to the south of the Arnon.", "On their journey the Israelites did not pass through Moab, but through the \"wilderness\" to the east ( Deuteronomy 2:8 ;  Judges 11:18 ), at length reaching the country to the north of the Arnon. Here they remained for some time till they had conquered Bashan (see  SIHON ;  OG ). The Moabites were alarmed, and their king, Balak, sought aid from the Midianites ( Numbers 22:2-4) . It was while they were here that the visit of Balaam (q.v.) to Balak took place. (See  MOSES .)", "After the Conquest, the Moabites maintained hostile relations with the Israelites, and frequently harassed them in war ( Judges 3:12-30 ; 1 Samuel 14). The story of Ruth, however, shows the existence of friendly relations between Moab and Bethlehem. By his descent from Ruth, David may be said to have had Moabite blood in his veins.

It shows the intervention of a power that is not limited by the laws either of matter or of mind, a power interrupting the fixed laws which govern their movements, a supernatural power.", "\"The suspension or violation of the laws of nature involved in miracles is nothing more than is constantly taking place around us. One force counteracts another- vital force keeps the chemical laws of matter in abeyance; and muscular force can control the action of physical force. When a man raises a weight from the ground, the law of gravity is neither suspended nor violated, but counteracted by a stronger force. The same is true as to the walking of Christ on the water and the swimming of iron at the command of the prophet. The simple and grand truth that the universe is not under the exclusive control of physical forces, but that everywhere and always there is above, separate from and superior to all else, an infinite personal will, not superseding, but directing and controlling all physical causes, acting with or without them.\" God ordinarily effects his purpose through the agency of second causes; but he has the power also of effecting his purpose immediately and without the intervention of second causes, i.e., of invading the fixed order, and thus of working miracles. Thus we affirm the possibility of miracles, the possibility of a higher hand intervening to control or reverse nature's ordinary movements.", "In the New Testament these four Greek words are principally used to designate miracles-", "1.

The sacred writers appealed to them as proofs that they were messengers of God. Our Lord also appealed to miracles as a conclusive proof of his divine mission ( John 5:20, 36 ;  10:25, 38 ). Thus, being out of the common course of nature and beyond the power of man, they are fitted to convey the impression of the presence and power of God. Where miracles are there certainly God is. The man, therefore, who works a miracle affords thereby clear proof that he comes with the authority of God; they are his credentials that he is God's messenger. The teacher points to these credentials, and they are a proof that he speaks with the authority of God. He boldly says, \"God bears me witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles.\"", "The credibility of miracles is established by the evidence of the senses on the part of those who are witnesses of them, and to all others by the testimony of such witnesses. The witnesses were competent, and their testimony is trustworthy. Unbelievers, following Hume, deny that any testimony can prove a miracle, because they say miracles are impossible. We have shown that miracles are possible, and surely they can be borne witness to. Surely they are credible when we have abundant and trustworthy evidence of their occurrence. They are credible just as any facts of history well authenticated are credible. Miracles, it is said, are contrary to experience. Of course they are contrary to our experience, but that does not prove that they were contrary to the experience of those who witnessed them. We believe a thousand facts, both of history and of science, that are contrary to our experience, but we believe them on the ground of competent testimony. An atheist or a pantheist must, as a matter of course, deny the possibility of miracles; but to one who believes in a personal God, who in his wisdom may see fit to interfere with the ordinary processes of nature, miracles are not impossible, nor are they incredible.

and this for the declared object of attesting that a divine mission is given to that man. It is not, therefore, the  wonder  , the exception to common experience, that constitutes the  miracle  , as is assumed both in the popular use of the word and by most objectors against miracles. No phenomenon in nature, however unusual, no event in the course of God's providence, however unexpected, is a miracle unless it can be traced to the agency of man (including prayer under the term agency), and unless it be put forth as a proof of divine mission. Prodigies and special providences are not miracles. (A miracle is not a  violation of the laws of nature.  It is God's acting upon nature in a degree far beyond our powers, but the same king of act as our wills are continually exerting upon nature. We do not in lifting a stone interfere with any law of nature, but exert a higher force among the laws. Prof. Tyndall says that \"science does assert that without a disturbance of natural law quite as serious as the stoppage of an eclipse, or the rolling of the St. Lawrence up the falls of Niagara, no act of humiliation, individual or nation, could call one shower from heaven.\" And yet men by firing cannon during battle can cause a shower: does that cause such a commotion among the laws of nature? The exertion of a  will  upon the laws does not make a disturbance of natural law; and a miracle is simply the exertion of God's will upon nature.", "ED.) Again, the term \"nature\" suggests to many persons the idea of a great system of things endowed with powers and forces of its own", "a sort of machine, set a-going originally by a first cause, but continuing its motions  of itself.  Hence we are apt to imagine that a change in the motion or operation of any part of it by God would produce the same disturbance of the other parts as such a change would be likely to produce in them if made by us or by any other natural agent. But if the motions and operations of material things be produced really by the divine will, then his choosing to change, for a special purpose, the ordinary motion of one part does not necessarily or probably imply his choosing to change the ordinary motions of other parts in a way not at all requisite for the accomplishment of that special purpose. It is as easy for him to continue the ordinary course of the rest, with the change of one part, as of all the phenomena without any change at all. Thus, though the stoppage of the motion of the earth in the ordinary course of nature would be attended with terrible convulsions, the stoppage of the earth  miraculously  , for a special purpose to be served by  that only  , would not of itself be followed by any such consequences. (Indeed, by the action of gravitation it could be stopped, as a stone thrown up is stopped, in less than two minutes, and yet so gently as not to stir the smallest feather or mote on its surface.", "ED.) From the same conception of nature as a machine, we are apt to think of interferences with the ordinary course of nature as implying some imperfection in it. But it is manifest that this is a false analogy; for the reason why machines are made is to save us trouble; and, therefore, they are more perfect in proportion as they answer this purpose. But no one can seriously imagine that the universe is a machine for the purpose of saving trouble to the Almighty. Again, when miracles are described as \"interferences with the law of nature,\" this description makes them appear improbable to many minds, from their not sufficiently considering that the laws of nature interfere with one another, and that we cannot get rid of \"interferences\" upon any hypothesis consistent with experience. The circumstances of the Christian miracles are utterly unlike those of any pretended instances of magical wonders. This difference consists in", "(1) The greatness, number, completeness and publicity of the miracles. (2) In the character of the miracles. They were all beneficial, helpful, instructive, and worthy of God as their author. (3) The natural beneficial tendency of the doctrine they attested.

It is usually included in Zion, to the north-east of which it lay, and from which it was separated by the Tyropoean valley.

Over the cave an ancient Christian church was erected, probably in the time of Justinian, the Roman emperor. This church has been converted into a Mohammedan mosque. The whole is surrounded by the el-Haram i.e., \"the sacred enclosure,\" about 200 feet long, 115 broad, and of an average height of about 50. This building, from the immense size of some of its stones, and the manner in which they are fitted together, is supposed by some to have been erected in the days of David or of Solomon, while others ascribe it to the time of Herod. It is looked upon as the most ancient and finest relic of Jewish architecture.", "On the floor of the mosque are erected six large cenotaphs as monuments to the dead who are buried in the cave beneath. Between the cenotaphs of Isaac and Rebekah there is a circular opening in the floor into the cavern below, the cave of Machpelah. Here it may be that the body of Jacob, which was embalmed in Egypt, is still preserved (much older embalmed bodies have recently been found in the cave of Deir el-Bahari in Egypt, see PHARAOH), though those of the others there buried may have long ago mouldered into dust. The interior of the mosque was visited by the Prince of Wales in 1862 by a special favour of the Mohammedan authorities. An interesting account of this visit is given in Dean Stanley's Lectures on the Jewish Church. It was also visited in 1866 by the Marquis of Bute, and in 1869 by the late Emperor (Frederick) of Germany, then the Crown Prince of Prussia. In 1881 it was visited by the two sons of the Prince of Wales, accompanied by Sir C. Wilson and others.

There is an account of his marriage to a Syrian ( 1 Chronicles 7:14 ); and the only thing afterwards recorded of him is, that his grandchildren were \"brought up upon Joseph's knees\" ( Genesis 50:23 ; R.V., \"born upon Joseph's knees\") i.e., were from their birth adopted by Joseph as his own children.", "The tribe of Manasseh was associated with that of Ephraim and Benjamin during the wanderings in the wilderness. They encamped on the west side of the tabernacle. According to the census taken at Sinai, this tribe then numbered 32,200 ( Numbers 1:10, 35 ;  2:20, 21 ). Forty years afterwards its numbers had increased to 52,700 ( 26:34, 37 ), and it was at this time the most distinguished of all the tribes.", "The half of this tribe, along with Reuben and Gad, had their territory assigned them by Moses on the east of the Jordan ( Joshua 13:7-14 ); but it was left for Joshua to define the limits of each tribe. This territory on the east of Jordan was more valuable and of larger extent than all that was allotted to the nine and a half tribes in the land of Palestine. It is sometimes called \"the land of Gilead,\" and is also spoken of as \"on the other side of Jordan.\" The portion given to the half tribe of Manasseh was the largest on the east of Jordan. It embraced the whole of Bashan. It was bounded on the south by Mahanaim, and extended north to the foot of Lebanon. Argob, with its sixty cities, that \"ocean of basaltic rocks and boulders tossed about in the wildest confusion,\" lay in the midst of this territory.", "The whole \"land of Gilead\" having been conquered, the two and a half tribes left their wives and families in the fortified cities there, and accompanied the other tribes across the Jordan, and took part with them in the wars of conquest. The allotment of the land having been completed, Joshua dismissed the two and a half tribes, commending them for their heroic service ( Joshua 22:1-34 ). Thus dismissed, they returned over Jordan to their own inheritance. (See  ED .)", "On the west of Jordan the other half of the tribe of Manasseh was associated with Ephraim, and they had their portion in the very centre of Palestine, an area of about 1,300 square miles, the most valuable part of the whole country, abounding in springs of water. Manasseh's portion was immediately to the north of that of Ephraim (Joshua 16). Thus the western Manasseh defended the passes of Esdraelon as the eastern kept the passes of the Hauran.", "2.  The only son and successor of Hezekiah on the throne of Judah. He was twelve years old when he began to reign ( 2 Kings 21:1 ), and he reigned fifty-five years (B.C. 698-643). Though he reigned so long, yet comparatively little is known of this king. His reign was a continuation of that of Ahaz, both in religion and national polity. He early fell under the influence of the heathen court circle, and his reign was characterized by a sad relapse into idolatry with all its vices, showing that the reformation under his father had been to a large extent only superficial ( Isaiah 7:10 ;  2 Kings 21:1 0-15). A systematic and persistent attempt was made, and all too successfully, to banish the worship of Jehovah out of the land. Amid this wide-spread idolatry there were not wanting, however, faithful prophets (Isaiah, Micah) who lifted up their voice in reproof and in warning. But their fidelity only aroused bitter hatred, and a period of cruel persecution against all the friends of the old religion began. \"The days of Alva in Holland, of Charles IX. in France, or of the Covenanters under Charles II. in Scotland, were anticipated in the Jewish capital. The streets were red with blood.\" There is an old Jewish tradition that Isaiah was put to death at this time ( 2 Kings 21:1 6;  24:3, 4 ;  Jeremiah 2:30 ), having been sawn asunder in the trunk of a tree. Psalms 49, 73, 77, 140, and 141 seem to express the feelings of the pious amid the fiery trials of this great persecution. Manasseh has been called the \"Nero of Palestine.\"", "Esarhaddon, Sennacherib's successor on the Assyrian throne, who had his residence in Babylon for thirteen years (the only Assyrian monarch who ever reigned in Babylon), took Manasseh prisoner (B.C. 681) to Babylon. Such captive kings were usually treated with great cruelty. They were brought before the conqueror with a hook or ring passed through their lips or their jaws, having a cord attached to it, by which they were led. This is referred to in  2 Chronicles 33:11 , where the Authorized Version reads that Esarhaddon \"took Manasseh among the thorns;\" while the Revised Version renders the words, \"took Manasseh in chains;\" or literally, as in the margin, \"with hooks.\" (Comp.  2 Kings 19:28 .)", "The severity of Manasseh's imprisonment brought him to repentance. God heard his cry, and he was restored to his kingdom ( 2 Chronicles 33:11-13 ). He abandoned his idolatrous ways, and enjoined the people to worship Jehovah; but there was no thorough reformation. After a lengthened reign extending through fifty-five years, the longest in the history of Judah, he died, and was buried in the garden of Uzza, the \"garden of his own house\" ( 2 Kings 21:1 7, 18;  2 Chronicles 33:20 ), and not in the city of David, among his ancestors. He was succeeded by his son Amon.", "In  Judges 18:30  the correct reading is \"Moses,\" and not \"Manasseh.\" The name \"Manasseh\" is supposed to have been introduced by some transcriber to avoid the scandal of naming the grandson of Moses the great lawgiver as the founder of an idolatrous religion."], "Word": "Manasseh", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "2": {"Definitions": ["forgetfulness; he that is forgotten"], "Word": "Manasseh", "Dictionary": "Hitchcock's Names Dictionary"}, "3": {"Definitions": ["1.

Whether the elder of the two sons was inferior in form or promise to the younger, or whether there was any external reason to justify the preference of Jacob, we are not told. In the division of the promised land half of the tribe of Manasseh settled east of the Jordan in the district embracing the hills of Gilead with their inaccessible heights and impassable ravines, and the almost impregnable tract of Argob.

It is said to have been founded by Menes, the first king of Egypt, and to have been in circumference about 19 miles. \"There are few remains above ground,\" says Manning (The Land of the Pharaohs), \"of the splendour of ancient Memphis. The city has utterly disappeared. If any traces yet exist, they are buried beneath the vast mounds of crumbling bricks and broken pottery which meet the eye in every direction. Near the village of Mitraheny is a colossal statue of Rameses the Great. It is apparently one of the two described by Herodotus and Diodorus as standing in front of the temple of Ptah. They were originally 50 feet in height. The one which remains, though mutilated, measures 48 feet. It is finely carved in limestone, which takes a high polish, and is evidently a portrait. It lies in a pit, which, during the inundation, is filled with water. As we gaze on this fallen and battered statue of the mighty conqueror who was probably contemporaneous with Moses, it is impossible not to remember the words of the prophet  Isaiah, 19:13 ;  44:16-19 , and  Jeremiah, 46:19 .\""], "Word": "Memphis", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "2": {"Definitions": ["abode of the good"], "Word": "Memphis", "Dictionary": "Hitchcock's Names Dictionary"}, "3": {"Definitions": ["Called also Noph.", "A celebrated city in Egypt Hosea 9:6", "Prophecies concerning Isaiah 19:13 ;  Jeremiah 2:16 ;  Jeremiah 46:14 ;  Jeremiah 46:19 ;  Ezekiel 30:16"], "Word": "Memphis", "Dictionary": "Naves Topical Index"}, "4": {"Definitions": ["( haven, of the good ), a city of ancient Egypt, situated on that western bank of the Nile, about nine miles south of Cairo and five from the great pyramids and the sphinx. It is mentioned by ( Isaiah 40:14,19 ) and Ezekiel, ( Ezekiel 30:13,16 ) under the name of Noph. Though some regard Thebes as the more ancient city, the monuments of Memphis are of higher antiquity than those of Thebus. The city is said to have had a circumference of about 10 miles. The temple of Apis was one of the most noted structures of Memphis. It stood opposite the southern portico of the temple of Ptah; and Psammetichus, who built that gateway, also erected in front of the sanctuary of Apis a magnificent colonnade, supported by colossal statues or Osiride pillars, such as may still be seen at the temple of Medeenet Habou at Thebes. Herod. ii, 153. Through this colonnade the Apis was led with great pomp upon state occasions. At Memphis was the reputed burial-place of Isis; it has also a temple to that \"myriad-named\" divinity. Memphis had also its Serapeium, which probably stood in the western quarter of the city. The sacred cubit until other symbols used in measuring the rise of the Nile were deposited in the temple of Serapis. The Necropolis, adjacent to Memphis, was on a scale of grandeur corresponding with the city itself. The \"city of the pyramids\" is a title of Memphis in the hieroglyphics upon the monuments. Memphis long held its place as a capital; and for centuries a Memphite dynasty ruled over all Egypt. Lepsius, Bunsen and Brugsch agree in regarding the third, fourth, sixth, seventh and eighth dynasties of the old empire as Memphite, reaching through a period of about 1000 years. The city's overthrow was distinctly predicted by the Hebrew prophets. ( Isaiah 19:13 ;  Jeremiah 46:19 ) The latest of these predictions was uttered nearly 600 years before Christ, and a half a century before the invasion of Egypt by Cambyses (cir, B.C. 525). Herodotus informs us that Cambyses, engaged at the opposition he encountered at Memphis, committed many outrages upon the city. The city never recovered from the blow inflicted by Cambyses. The rise of Alexandria hastened its decline. The caliph conquerors founded Fostat (old Cairo) upon the opposite bank of the Nile, a few miles north of Memphis, and brought materials from the old city to build their new capital, A.D. 638. At length so complete was the ruin of Memphis that for a long time its very site was lost. Recent explorations have brought to light many of its antiquities."], "Word": "Memphis", "Dictionary": "Smith's Bible Dictionary"}}}

( John 1:41 ;  4:25 ) Authorized Version \"Messias.\" The earliest gleam of the gospel is found in the account of the fall. ( Genesis 3:15 ) the blessings in store for the children of Shem are remarkable indicated int he words of Noah. ( Genesis 9:26 ) Next follows the promise to Abraham. ( Genesis 12:2,3 ) A great step is made in ( Genesis 49:10 ) This is the first case in which the promises distinctly centre in one person. The next passage usually quoted is the prophecy of Balaam. ( Numbers 24:17-19 ) The prophecy of Moses, ( 18:18 ) claims attention. Passages in the Psalms are numerous which are applied to the Messiah in the New Testament; such as Psalms 2,16,22,40,110. The advance in clearness in this period is great. The name of Anointed, i.e. King, comes in, and the Messiah is to come of the Lineage of David. He is described in his exaltation, with his great kingdom that shall be spiritual rather than temporal. Psalms 2,21,40,110. In other places he is seen in suffering and humiliation. Psalms 16,22,40. Later on the prophets show the Messiah as a king and ruler of David's house, who should come to reform and restore the Jewish nation and purify the Church, as in Isaiah 11,40-66 The blessings of the restoration, however, will not be confined to Jews; the heathen are made to share them fully. ( Isaiah 2:66 ) The passage of ( Micah 5:2 ) (comp.  Matthew 2:6 ) left no doubt in the mind of the Sanhedrin as to the birthplace of the Messiah. The lineage of David is again alluded to in ( Zechariah 12:1-14 ) The coming of the Forerunner and of the Anointed is clearly revealed in ( Malachi 3:1 ;  4:5,6 ) The Pharisees and those of the Jews who expected Messiah at all looked for a temporal prince only. The apostles themselves were infected with this opinion till after the resurrection.

On the invitation of Pharaoh ( Genesis 45:17-25 ), Jacob and his sons went down into Egypt. This immigration took place probably about 350 years before the birth of Moses. Some centuries before Joseph, Egypt had been conquered by a pastoral Semitic race from Asia, the Hyksos, who brought into cruel subjection the native Egyptians, who were an African race. Jacob and his retinue were accustomed to a shepherd's life, and on their arrival in Egypt were received with favour by the king, who assigned them the \"best of the land\", the land of Goshen, to dwell in. The Hyksos or \"shepherd\" king who thus showed favour to Joseph and his family was in all probability the Pharaoh Apopi (or Apopis).", "Thus favoured, the Israelites began to \"multiply exceedingly\" ( Genesis 47:27 ), and extended to the west and south. At length the supremacy of the Hyksos came to an end. The descendants of Jacob were allowed to retain their possession of Goshen undisturbed, but after the death of Joseph their position was not so favourable. The Egyptians began to despise them, and the period of their \"affliction\" ( Genesis 15:13 ) commenced. They were sorely oppressed. They continued, however, to increase in numbers, and \"the land was filled with them\" ( Exodus 1:7 ). The native Egyptians regarded them with suspicion, so that they felt all the hardship of a struggle for existence.", "In process of time \"a king [probably Seti I.] arose who knew not Joseph\" ( Exodus 1:8 ). (See  PHARAOH .) The circumstances of the country were such that this king thought it necessary to weaken his Israelite subjects by oppressing them, and by degrees reducing their number. They were accordingly made public slaves, and were employed in connection with his numerous buildings, especially in the erection of store-cities, temples, and palaces. The children of Israel were made to serve with rigour. Their lives were made bitter with hard bondage, and \"all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour\" ( Exodus 1:13, 14 ). But this cruel oppression had not the result expected of reducing their number. On the contrary, \"the more the Egyptians afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew\" ( Exodus 1:12 ).", "The king next tried, through a compact secretly made with the guild of midwives, to bring about the destruction of all the Hebrew male children that might be born. But the king's wish was not rigorously enforced; the male children were spared by the midwives, so that \"the people multiplied\" more than ever. Thus baffled, the king issued a public proclamation calling on the people to put to death all the Hebrew male children by casting them into the river ( Exodus 1:22 ). But neither by this edict was the king's purpose effected.", "One of the Hebrew households into which this cruel edict of the king brought great alarm was that of Amram, of the family of the Kohathites ( Exodus 6:16-20 ), who with his wife Jochebed and two children, Miriam, a girl of perhaps fifteen years of age, and Aaron, a boy of three years, resided in or near Memphis, the capital city of that time. In this quiet home a male child was born (B.C. 1571). His mother concealed him in the house for three months from the knowledge of the civic authorities. But when the task of concealment became difficult, Jochebed contrived to bring her child under the notice of the daughter of the king by constructing for him an ark of bulrushes, which she laid among the flags which grew on the edge of the river at the spot where the princess was wont to come down and bathe. Her plan was successful. The king's daughter \"saw the child; and behold the child wept.\" The princess (see  PHARAOH'S DAUGHTER  ) sent Miriam, who was standing by, to fetch a nurse. She went and brought the mother of the child, to whom the princess said, \"Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages.\" Thus Jochebed's child, whom the princess called \"Moses\", i.e., \"Saved from the water\" ( Exodus 2:10 ), was ultimately restored to her.", "As soon as the natural time for weaning the child had come, he was transferred from the humble abode of his father to the royal palace, where he was brought up as the adopted son of the princess, his mother probably accompanying him and caring still for him. He grew up amid all the grandeur and excitement of the Egyptian court, maintaining, however, probably a constant fellowship with his mother, which was of the highest importance as to his religious belief and his interest in his \"brethren.\" His education would doubtless be carefully attended to, and he would enjoy all the advantages of training both as to his body and his mind. He at length became \"learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians\" ( Acts 7:22 ). Egypt had then two chief seats of learning, or universities, at one of which, probably that of Heliopolis, his education was completed. Moses, being now about twenty years of age, spent over twenty more before he came into prominence in Bible history. These twenty years were probably spent in military service. There is a tradition recorded by Josephus that he took a lead in the war which was then waged between Egypt and Ethiopia, in which he gained renown as a skilful general, and became \"mighty in deeds\" ( Acts 7:22 ).", "After the termination of the war in Ethiopia, Moses returned to the Egyptian court, where he might reasonably have expected to be loaded with honours and enriched with wealth. But \"beneath the smooth current of his life hitherto, a life of alternate luxury at the court and comparative hardness in the camp and in the discharge of his military duties, there had lurked from childhood to youth, and from youth to manhood, a secret discontent, perhaps a secret ambition. Moses, amid all his Egyptian surroundings, had never forgotten, had never wished to forget, that he was a Hebrew.\" He now resolved to make himself acquainted with the condition of his countrymen, and \"went out unto his brethren, and looked upon their burdens\" ( Exodus 2:11 ). This tour of inspection revealed to him the cruel oppression and bondage under which they everywhere groaned, and could not fail to press on him the serious consideration of his duty regarding them. The time had arrived for his making common cause with them, that he might thereby help to break their yoke of bondage. He made his choice accordingly ( Hebrews 11:25-27 ), assured that God would bless his resolution for the welfare of his people. He now left the palace of the king and took up his abode, probably in his father's house, as one of the Hebrew people who had for forty years been suffering cruel wrong at the hands of the Egyptians.", "He could not remain indifferent to the state of things around him, and going out one day among the people, his indignation was roused against an Egyptian who was maltreating a Hebrew. He rashly lifted up his hand and slew the Egyptian, and hid his body in the sand. Next day he went out again and found two Hebrews striving together. He speedily found that the deed of the previous day was known. It reached the ears of Pharaoh (the \"great Rameses,\" Rameses II.), who \"sought to slay Moses\" ( Exodus 2:15 ). Moved by fear, Moses fled from Egypt, and betook himself to the land of Midian, the southern part of the peninsula of Sinai, probably by much the same route as that by which, forty years afterwards, he led the Israelites to Sinai. He was providentially led to find a new home with the family of Reuel, where he remained for forty years ( Acts 7:30 ), under training unconsciously for his great life's work.", "Suddenly the angel of the Lord appeared to him in the burning bush (Exodus 3), and commissioned him to go down to Egypt and \"bring forth the children of Israel\" out of bondage. He was at first unwilling to go, but at length he was obedient to the heavenly vision, and left the land of Midian ( 4:18-26 ). On the way he was met by Aaron (q.v.) and the elders of Israel (27-31). He and Aaron had a hard task before them; but the Lord was with them (ch. 7-12), and the ransomed host went forth in triumph. (See  EXODUS .) After an eventful journey to and fro in the wilderness, we see them at length encamped in the plains of Moab, ready to cross over the Jordan into the Promised Land. There Moses addressed the assembled elders ( Deuteronomy 1:1-4;   5:1-26:19 ;  27:11-30:20 ), and gives the people his last counsels, and then rehearses the great song (Deuteronomy 32), clothing in fitting words the deep emotions of his heart at such a time, and in review of such a marvellous history as that in which he had acted so conspicious a part. Then, after blessing the tribes (33), he ascends to \"the mountain of Nebo (q.v.), to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho\" ( 34:1 ), and from thence he surveys the land. \"Jehovah shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan, and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea, and the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar\" ( Deuteronomy 34:2-3) , the magnificient inheritance of the tribes of whom he had been so long the leader; and there he died, being one hundred and twenty years old, according to the word of the Lord, and was buried by the Lord \"in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Beth-peor\" ( 34:6 ). The people mourned for him during thirty days.", "Thus died \"Moses the man of God\" ( Deuteronomy 33:1 ;  Joshua 14:6 ). He was distinguished for his meekness and patience and firmness, and \"he endured as seeing him who is invisible.\" \"There arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face, in all the signs and the wonders, which the Lord sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land, and in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel\" ( Deuteronomy 34:10-12 ).", "The name of Moses occurs frequently in the Psalms and Prophets as the chief of the prophets.", "In the New Testament he is referred to as the representative of the law and as a type of Christ ( John 1:17 ;  2 Corinthians 3:13-18 ;  Hebrews 3:5, 6 ). Moses is the only character in the Old Testament to whom Christ likens himself ( John 5:46 ; comp.  Deuteronomy 18:15, 18, 19 ;  Acts 7:37 ). In  Hebrews 3:1-19  this likeness to Moses is set forth in various particulars.", "In  Jude 1:9  mention is made of a contention between Michael and the devil about the body of Moses.

Mosheh  , \"drawn,\" i.e. from the water; in the Coptic it means \"saved from the water\"), the legislator of the Jewish people, and in a certain sense the founder of the Jewish religion. The immediate pedigree of Moses is as follows: Levi was the father of: Gershon", "Kohath", "Merari Kohath was the father of: Amram = Jochebed Amram = Jochebed was the father of: Hur = Miriam", "Aaron = Elisheba", "Moses = Zipporah Aaron = Elisheba was the father of: Nadab", "Abihu", "Eleazar", "Ithamar Eleazar was the father of: Phineas Moses = Zipporah was the father of: Gershom", "Eliezer Gershom was the father of: Jonathan The history of Moses naturally divides itself into three periods of 40 years each. Moses was born at Goshen, In Egypt, B.C. 1571. The story of his birth is thoroughly Egyptian in its scene. His mother made extraordinary efforts for his preservation from the general destruction of the male children of Isr'l. For three months the child was concealed in the house. Then his mother placed him in a small boat or basket of papyrus, closed against the water by bitumen. This was placed among the aquatic vegetation by the side of one of the canals of the Nile. The sister lingered to watch her brother's fate. The Egyptian princess, who, tradition says, was a childless wife, came down to bathe in the sacred river. Her attendant slaves followed her. She saw the basket in the flags, and despatched divers, who brought it. It was opened, and the cry of the child moved the princess to compassion. She determined to rear it as her own. The sister was at hand to recommend a Hebrew nurse, the child's own mother. here was the  first part  of Moses' training,", "a training at home in the true religion, in faith in God, in the promises to his nation, in the life of a saint,", "a training which he never forgot, even amid the splendors and gilded sin of Pharaoh's court. The child was adopted by the princess. From this time for many years Moses must be considered as an Egyptian. In the Pentateuch this period is a blank, but in the New Testament he is represented as \"learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians,\" and as \"mighty in words and deeds.\" ( Acts 7:22 ) this was the  second part  of Moses' training. The second period of Moses' life began when he was forty years old. Seeing the sufferings of his people, Moses determined to go to them as their helper, and made his great life-choice, \"choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt.\" ( Hebrews 11:25,26 ) Seeing an Isr'lite suffering the bastinado from an Egyptian, and thinking that they were alone, he slew the Egyptian, and buried the corpse in the sand. But the people soon showed themselves unfitted as yet to obtain their freedom, nor was Moses yet fitted to be their leader. He was compelled to leave Egypt when the slaying of the Egyptian became known, and he fled to the land of Midian, in the southern and southeastern part of the Sinai peninsula. There was a famous well (\"the well,\") ( Exodus 2:15 ) surrounded by tanks for the watering of the flocks of the Bedouin herdsmen. By this well the fugitive seated himself and watched the gathering of the sheep. There were the Arabian shepherds, and there were also seven maidens, whom the shepherds rudely drove away from the water. The chivalrous spirit which had already broken forth in behalf of his oppressed countrymen broke forth again in behalf of the distressed maidens. They returned unusually soon to their father, Jethro, and told him of their adventure. Moses, who up to this time had been \"an Egyptian,\" ( Exodus 2:19 ) now became for a time an Arabian. He married Zipporah, daughter of his host, to whom he also became the slave and shepherd. ( Exodus 2:21 ;  3:1 ) Here for forty years Moses communed with God and with nature, escaping from the false ideas taught him in Egypt, and sifting out the truths that were there. This was the  third process  of his training for his work; and from this training he learned infinitely more than from Egypt. Stanely well says, after enumerating what the Isr'lites derived from Egypt, that the contrast was always greater than the likeness. This process was completed when God met him on Horeb, appearing in a burning bush, and, communicating with him, appointed him to be the leader and deliverer of his people. Now begins the third period of forty years in Moses' life. He meets Aaron, his next younger brother, whom God permitted to be the spokesman, and together they return to Goshen in Egypt. From this time the history of Moses is the history of Isr'l for the next forty years. Aaron spoke and acted for Moses, and was the permanent inheritor of the sacred staff of power. But Moses was the inspiring soul behind. he is incontestably the chief personage of the history, in a sense in which no one else is described before or since. He was led into a closer communion with the invisible world than was vouchsafed to any other in the Old Testament. There are two main characters in which he appears", "as a leader and as a prophet. (1) As a leader, his life divides itself into the three epochs", "the march to Sinai; the march from Sinai to Kadesh; and the conquest of the transjordanic kingdoms. On approaching Palestine the office of the leader becomes blended with that of the general or the conqueror. By Moses the spies were sent to explore the country. Against his advice took place the first disastrous battle at hormah. To his guidance is ascribed the circuitous route by which the nation approached Palestine from the east, and to his generalship the two successful campaigns in which Sihon and Og were defeated. The narrative is told so briefly that we are in danger of forgetting that at this last stage of his life Moses must have been as much a conqueror and victorious soldier as was Joshua. (2) His character as a prophet is, from the nature of the case, more distinctly brought out. He is the first as he is the greatest example of a prophet in the Old Testament. His brother and sister were both endowed with prophetic gifts. The seventy elders, and Eldad and Medad also, all \"prophesied.\" ( Numbers 11:25-27 ) But Moses rose high above all these. With him the divine revelations were made \"mouth to mouth.\" ( Numbers 12:8 ) Of the special modes of this more direct communication, four great examples are given, corresponding to four critical epochs in his historical career. (a) The appearance of the divine presence in the flaming acacia tree. ( Exodus 3:2-6 ) (b) In the giving of the law from Mount Sinai, the outward form of the revelation was a thick darkness as of a thunder-cloud, out of which proceeded a voice. ( Exodus 19:19 ;  20:21 ) on two occasions he is described as having penetrated within the darkness. ( Exodus 24:18 ;  34:28 ) (c) It was nearly at the close of these communications in the mountains of Sinai that an especial revelation of God was made to him personally. ( Exodus 33:21,22 ;  34:5,6,7 ) God passed before him. (d) The fourth mode of divine manifestation was that which is described as beginning at this juncture, and which was maintained with more or less continuity through the rest of his career. ( Exodus 33:7 ) It was the communication with God in the tabernacle from out the pillar of cloud and fire. There is another form of Moses' prophetic gift, viz., the poetical form of composition which characterizes the Jewish prophecy generally.

The word matter is evidently from the Ar. madda, to secrete, eject or discharge a purulent substance; and I think cannot have any direct connection with mud.

(Marcus was his Latin surname. His Jewish name was John, which is the same as Johanan ( the grace of God ). We can almost trace the steps whereby the former became his prevalent name in the Church. \"John, whose surname was Mark\" in ( Acts 12:12,25 ;  15:37 ) becomes \"John\" alone in ( Acts 13:5,13 ) \"Mark\" in ( Acts 15:39 ) and thenceforward there is no change. ( Colossians 4:10 );  Philemon 1:24 ;  2 Timothy 4:11  The evangelist was the son of a certain Mary, a Jewish matron of some position who dwelt in Jerusalem, ( Acts 12:12 ) and was probably born of a Hellenistic family in that city. Of his father we know nothing; but we do know that the future evangelist was cousin of Barnabas of Cyprus, the great friend of St. Paul. His mother would seem to have been intimately acquainted with St. Peter, and it was to her house, as to a familiar home, that the apostle repaired, A.D. 44, after his deliverance from prison ( Acts 12:12 ) This fact accounts for St. Mark's intimate acquaintance with that apostle, to whom also he probably owed his conversion, for St. Peter calls him his son. ( 1 Peter 5:13 ) We hear Of him for the first time in  Acts 15:25  where we find him accompanying and Barnabas on their return from Jerusalem to Antioch, A.D. 45. He next comes before us on the occasion of the earliest missionary journey of the same apostles, A.D. 48, when he joined them as their \"minister.\" ( Acts 13:8 ) With them he visited Cyprus; but at Perga in Pamphylia, ( Acts 13:13 ) when they were about to enter upon the more arduous part of their mission, he left them, and, for some unexplained reason, returned to Jerusalem to his mother and his home. Notwithstanding this, we find him at Paul's side during that apostle's first imprisonment at Rome, A.D. 61-63, and he Is acknowledged by him as one of his few fellow laborers who had been a \"comfort\" to him during the weary hours of his imprisonment. ( Colossians 4:10,11 );  Philemon 1:24  We next have traces of him in ( 1 Peter 5:13 ) \"The church that is in Babylon ... saluteth you, and so doth Marcus my son.\" From this we infer that he joined his spiritual father, the great friend of his mother, at Babylon, then and for same hundred years afterward one of the chief seats of Jewish culture. From Babylon he would seem to have returned to Asia Minor; for during his second imprisonment A.D. 68 St. Paul, writing to Timothy charges him to bring Mark with him to me, on the ground that he was \"profitable to him For the ministry.\" ( 2 Timothy 4:11 ) From this point we gain no further information from the New Testament respecting the evangelist. It is most probable, however that he did join the apostle at Rome whither also St. Peter would seem to have proceeded, and suffered martyrdom with St. Paul.

(Comp.  Luke 7:36-50 .) (See  ABRAHAM'S BOSOM ;  BANQUET ;  FEAST .)"], "Word": "Meals", "Dictionary": "Easton's Bible Dictionary"}, "6": {"Definitions": ["Our information on the subject of meals is but scanty. The early Hebrews do not seem to have given special names to their several meals, for the terms rendered \"dine\" and \"dinner\" in the Authorized Version (( Genesis 43:16 ;  Proverbs 15:17 )) are in reality general expressions, which might more correctly be rendered \"eat\" and \"portion of food.\" In the New Testament \"dinner\" and \"supper,\" ( Luke 14:12 ;  John 21:12 ) are more properly \"breakfast\" and \"dinner.\" There is some uncertainty as to the hours at which meals were taken; the Egyptians undoubtedly took their principal mean at noon, ( Genesis 43:16 ) laborers took a light meal at that time. ( Ruth 2:14 ) comp. ver.  Ruth 2:17  The Jews rather followed the custom that prevails among the Bedouins, and made their principal meal after sunset, and a lighter meal at about 9 or 10 A.M. The old Hebrews were in the habit of  sitting  . ( Genesis 27:19 ;  Judges 19:6 ;  1 Samuel 20:5,24 ;  1 Kings 13:20 ) The table was in this case but slightly elevated above the ground, as is still the case in Egypt. As luxury increased, the practice of sitting was exchanged for that of reclining was the universal custom. As several guests reclined on the same couch, each overlapped his neighbor, as it were, and rested his head on or near the breast of the one who lay behind him; he was then said to \"lean on the bosom\" of his neighbor. ( John 13:23 ;  21:20 ) The ordinary arrangement of the couches was in three sides of a square, the fourth being left open for the servants to bring up the dishes. Some doubt attends the question whether the females took their meals along with the males. Before commencing the meal the guests washed their hands. This custom was founded on natural decorum- not only was the hand the substitute for our knife and for, but the hands of all the guests were dipped into one and the same dish. Another preliminary step was the grace or blessing, of which we have but one instance in the Old Testament", "( 1 Samuel 9:13 )", "and more than one pronounced by our Lord himself in the new Testament", "Matthew 15:36 ;  Luke 9:16 ;  John 6:11  The mode of taking the food differed in no material point from the modern usages of the East. Generally there was a single dish, into which each guest dipped his hand. ( Matthew 26:23 ) Occasionally separate portions were served out to each. ( Genesis 43:34 ;  Ruth 2:14 ;  1 Samuel 1:4 ) A piece of bread was held between the thumb and two fingers of the right hand, and was dipped either into a bowl of melted grease (in which case it was termed \"a sop,\") ( John 13:26 ) or into the dish of meat, whence a piece was conveyed to the mouth between the layers of bread. At the conclusion of the meal, grace was again said in conformity with ( 8:10 ) and the hands were again washed. On state occasions more ceremony was used, and the meal was enlivened in various ways. A sumptuous repast was prepared; the guests were previously invited, ( Esther 5:8 ;  Matthew 22:3 ) and on the day of the feast a second invitation was issued to those that were bidden. ( Esther 6:14 ;  Proverbs 9:3 ;  Matthew 22:4 ) The visitors were received with a kiss, ( Luke 7:45 ) water was furnished for them to wash their feet with, ( Luke 7:44 ) the head, the beard, the feet, and sometimes the clothes, were perfumed with ointment, ( Psalms 23:5 ;  John 12:3 ) on special occasions robes were provided, ( Matthew 22:11 ) and the head was decorated with wreaths. ( Isaiah 28:1 ) The regulation of the feast was under the superintendence of a special officer, ( John 2:8 ) (Authorized Version \"governor of the feast\"), whose business it was to taste the food and the liquors before they were placed on the table, and to settle about the toasts and amusements; he was generally one of the guests, Ecclus. 32.1,2, and might therefore take part in the conversation. The places of the guests were settled according to their respective rand, ( Genesis 43:33 ;  Mark 12:39 ) portions of food were placed before each, ( 1 Samuel 1:4 ) the most honored guests receiving either larger, ( Genesis 43:34 ) or more choice, ( 1 Samuel 9:24 ) portions than the rest. The meal was enlivened with music, singing and dancing, ( 2 Samuel 19:35 ) or with riddles, ( Judges 14:12 ) and amid these entertainments the festival was prolonged for several days.

Still we have no trace of any philosophical or rational system of Egyptian origin; still medicine in Egypt was a mere art or profession. Compared with the wild countries around them, however, the Egyptians must have seemed incalculably advanced. Representations of early Egyptian surgery apparently occur on some of the monuments of Beni-Hassan. Those who have assisted at the opening of a mummy have noticed that the teeth exhibited a dentistry not inferior in execution to the work of the best modern experts. This confirms the statement of Herodotus that every part of the body was studied by a distinct practitioner. The reputation of Egypt's practitioners in historical times was such that both Cyrus and Darius sent to that country for physicians or surgeons. Of midwifery we have a distinct notice, ( Exodus 1:1 ) and of women as its Practitioners, which fact may also be verified from the scriptures. The scrupulous attention paid to the dead was favorable to the health of the living. The practice of physic was not among the Jews a privilege of the priesthood. Any one might practice it, and this publicity must have kept it pure. Rank and honor are said to be the portion of the physician, and his office to be from the Lord. Ecclus. 38.1,3,12. To bring down the subject to the period of the New Testament, St. Luke, \"the beloved physician,\" who practiced at Antioch whilst the body was his care, could hardly have failed to be convenient with all the leading opinions current down to his own time. Among special diseases named in the Old Testament is ophthalmia, ( Genesis 29:17 ) which is perhaps more common in Syria and Egypt than anywhere else in the world; especially in the fig season, the juice of the newly-ripe fruit having the power of giving it. It may occasion partial or total blindness. ( 2 Kings 6:18 ) The \"burning boil,\" ( Leviticus 13:23 ) is merely marked by the notion of an effect resembling that of fire, like our \"carbuncle.\" The diseases rendered \"scab\" and \"scurvy\" in ( Leviticus 21:20 ;  22:22 ;  28:27 ) may be almost any skin disease. Some of these may be said to approach the type of leprosy. The \"botch ( shechin ) of Egypt,\" ( 28:27 ) is so vague a term as to yield a most uncertain sense. In ( 28:35 ) is mentioned a disease attacking the \"knees and legs,\" consisting in a \"sore botch which cannot be healed,\" but extended, in the sequel of the verse, from the \"sole of the foot to the top of the head.\" The  Elephantiasis gracorum  is what now passes under the name of \"leprosy;\" the lepers, e.g., of the- huts near the Zion gate of modern Jerusalem are elephantissiacs. [ LEPER, LEPROSY ] The disease of King Antiochus, 2 Macc. 9.5-10, etc., was that of a boil breeding worms. The case of the widow's son restored by Elisha, ( 2 Kings 4:19 ) was probably one of sunstroke. The palsy meets us in the New Testament only, and in features too familiar to need special remark. palsy, gangrene and cancer were common in all the countries familiar to the scriptural writers, and neither differs from the modern disease of the same name. Mention is also made of the bites and stings of poisonous reptiles. ( Numbers 21:6 ) Among surgical instruments or pieces of apparatus the following only are alluded to in Scripture- A cutting instrument, supposed a \"sharp stone,\" ( Exodus 4:25 ) the \"knife\" of ( Joshua 5:2 ) The \"awl\" of ( Exodus 21:6 ) was probably a surgical instrument. The \"roller to bind\" of ( Ezekiel 30:21 ) was for a broken limb, and is still used. A scraper, for which the \"potsherd\" of Job was a substitute. ( Job 2:8 ;  Exodus 30:23-25 ) is a prescription in form. An occasional trace occurs of some chemical knowledge, e.g. the calcination of the gold by Moses, ( Exodus 32:20 ) the effect of \"vinegar upon natron,\" ( Proverbs 25:20 ); comp.  Jeremiah 2:22  The mention of \"the apothecary,\" ( Exodus 30:35 ;  Ecclesiastes 10:1 ) and of the merchant in \"powders,\" ( Solomon 3:6 ) shows that a distinct and important branch of trade was set up in these wares, in which, as at a modern druggist's, articles of luxury, etc., are combined with the remedies of sickness. Among the most favorite of external remedies has always been the bath. There were special occasions on which the bath was ceremonially enjoined. The Pharisees and Essenes aimed at scrupulous strictness in all such rules. ( Matthew 15:2 ;  Mark 7:5 ;  Luke 11:38 ) River-bathing was common but houses soon began to include a bathroom.

(Marcus was his Latin surname. His Jewish name was John, which is the same as Johanan ( the grace of God ). We can almost trace the steps whereby the former became his prevalent name in the Church. \"John, whose surname was Mark\" in ( Acts 12:12,25 ;  15:37 ) becomes \"John\" alone in ( Acts 13:5,13 ) \"Mark\" in ( Acts 15:39 ) and thenceforward there is no change. ( Colossians 4:10 );  Philemon 1:24 ;  2 Timothy 4:11  The evangelist was the son of a certain Mary, a Jewish matron of some position who dwelt in Jerusalem, ( Acts 12:12 ) and was probably born of a Hellenistic family in that city. Of his father we know nothing; but we do know that the future evangelist was cousin of Barnabas of Cyprus, the great friend of St. Paul. His mother would seem to have been intimately acquainted with St. Peter, and it was to her house, as to a familiar home, that the apostle repaired, A.D. 44, after his deliverance from prison ( Acts 12:12 ) This fact accounts for St. Mark's intimate acquaintance with that apostle, to whom also he probably owed his conversion, for St. Peter calls him his son. ( 1 Peter 5:13 ) We hear Of him for the first time in  Acts 15:25  where we find him accompanying and Barnabas on their return from Jerusalem to Antioch, A.D. 45. He next comes before us on the occasion of the earliest missionary journey of the same apostles, A.D. 48, when he joined them as their \"minister.\" ( Acts 13:8 ) With them he visited Cyprus; but at Perga in Pamphylia, ( Acts 13:13 ) when they were about to enter upon the more arduous part of their mission, he left them, and, for some unexplained reason, returned to Jerusalem to his mother and his home. Notwithstanding this, we find him at Paul's side during that apostle's first imprisonment at Rome, A.D. 61-63, and he Is acknowledged by him as one of his few fellow laborers who had been a \"comfort\" to him during the weary hours of his imprisonment. ( Colossians 4:10,11 );  Philemon 1:24  We next have traces of him in ( 1 Peter 5:13 ) \"The church that is in Babylon ... saluteth you, and so doth Marcus my son.\" From this we infer that he joined his spiritual father, the great friend of his mother, at Babylon, then and for same hundred years afterward one of the chief seats of Jewish culture. From Babylon he would seem to have returned to Asia Minor; for during his second imprisonment A.D. 68 St. Paul, writing to Timothy charges him to bring Mark with him to me, on the ground that he was \"profitable to him For the ministry.\" ( 2 Timothy 4:11 ) From this point we gain no further information from the New Testament respecting the evangelist. It is most probable, however that he did join the apostle at Rome whither also St. Peter would seem to have proceeded, and suffered martyrdom with St. Paul.

(Marcus was his Latin surname. His Jewish name was John, which is the same as Johanan ( the grace of God ). We can almost trace the steps whereby the former became his prevalent name in the Church. \"John, whose surname was Mark\" in ( Acts 12:12,25 ;  15:37 ) becomes \"John\" alone in ( Acts 13:5,13 ) \"Mark\" in ( Acts 15:39 ) and thenceforward there is no change. ( Colossians 4:10 );  Philemon 1:24 ;  2 Timothy 4:11  The evangelist was the son of a certain Mary, a Jewish matron of some position who dwelt in Jerusalem, ( Acts 12:12 ) and was probably born of a Hellenistic family in that city. Of his father we know nothing; but we do know that the future evangelist was cousin of Barnabas of Cyprus, the great friend of St. Paul. His mother would seem to have been intimately acquainted with St. Peter, and it was to her house, as to a familiar home, that the apostle repaired, A.D. 44, after his deliverance from prison ( Acts 12:12 ) This fact accounts for St. Mark's intimate acquaintance with that apostle, to whom also he probably owed his conversion, for St. Peter calls him his son. ( 1 Peter 5:13 ) We hear Of him for the first time in  Acts 15:25  where we find him accompanying and Barnabas on their return from Jerusalem to Antioch, A.D. 45. He next comes before us on the occasion of the earliest missionary journey of the same apostles, A.D. 48, when he joined them as their \"minister.\" ( Acts 13:8 ) With them he visited Cyprus; but at Perga in Pamphylia, ( Acts 13:13 ) when they were about to enter upon the more arduous part of their mission, he left them, and, for some unexplained reason, returned to Jerusalem to his mother and his home. Notwithstanding this, we find him at Paul's side during that apostle's first imprisonment at Rome, A.D. 61-63, and he Is acknowledged by him as one of his few fellow laborers who had been a \"comfort\" to him during the weary hours of his imprisonment. ( Colossians 4:10,11 );  Philemon 1:24  We next have traces of him in ( 1 Peter 5:13 ) \"The church that is in Babylon ... saluteth you, and so doth Marcus my son.\" From this we infer that he joined his spiritual father, the great friend of his mother, at Babylon, then and for same hundred years afterward one of the chief seats of Jewish culture. From Babylon he would seem to have returned to Asia Minor; for during his second imprisonment A.D. 68 St. Paul, writing to Timothy charges him to bring Mark with him to me, on the ground that he was \"profitable to him For the ministry.\" ( 2 Timothy 4:11 ) From this point we gain no further information from the New Testament respecting the evangelist. It is most probable, however that he did join the apostle at Rome whither also St. Peter would seem to have proceeded, and suffered martyrdom with St. Paul.
