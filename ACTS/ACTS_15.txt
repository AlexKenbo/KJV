ACTS 15:13 And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me:

ACTS 15:15 And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,
ACTS 15:16 After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:

ACTS 15:26 Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
ACTS 15:27 We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth.
