JOB 36:1 Elihu also proceeded, and said,
JOB 36:2 Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf.
JOB 36:3 I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
JOB 36:4 For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.
JOB 36:5 Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.
JOB 36:6 He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.
JOB 36:7 He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.
JOB 36:8 And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction;
JOB 36:9 Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.
JOB 36:10 He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.
JOB 36:11 If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.
JOB 36:12 But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.
JOB 36:13 But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.
JOB 36:14 They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.
JOB 36:15 He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.
JOB 36:16 Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.
JOB 36:17 But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee.
JOB 36:18 Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.
JOB 36:19 Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.
JOB 36:20 Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.
JOB 36:21 Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.
JOB 36:22 Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?
JOB 36:23 Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?
JOB 36:24 Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.
JOB 36:25 Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.
JOB 36:26 Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.
JOB 36:27 For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:
JOB 36:28 Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.
JOB 36:29 Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle?
JOB 36:30 Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.
JOB 36:31 For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.
JOB 36:32 With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.
JOB 36:33 The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.
