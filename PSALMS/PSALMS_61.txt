 PS 61:1 Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer. 
 PS 61:2 From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I. 
 PS 61:3 For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy. 
 PS 61:4 I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah. 
 PS 61:5 For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name. 
 PS 61:6 Thou wilt prolong the king's life: and his years as many generations. 
 PS 61:7 He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him. 
 PS 61:8 So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows.
