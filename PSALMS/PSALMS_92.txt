PS 92:1 IT IS A GOOD THING TO GIVE THANKS UNTO THE LORD, AND TO SING PRAISES UNTO THY NAME, O MOST HIGH:
PS 92:2 To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night,
PS 92:3 Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound.
PS 92:4 For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.
PS 92:5 O LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep.
PS 92:6 A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this.
PS 92:7 When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever:
PS 92:8 But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore.
PS 92:9 For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
PS 92:10 But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.
PS 92:11 Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me.
PS 92:12 The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
PS 92:13 Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God.
PS 92:14 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing;
PS 92:15 To shew that the LORD is upright: he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
